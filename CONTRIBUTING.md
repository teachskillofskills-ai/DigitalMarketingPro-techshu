# Contributing to Digital Marketing Pro

This guide covers how to contribute to the Digital Marketing Pro plugin effectively.

> **Who this is for.** These repositories are the TechShu line of the marketing plugins:
> maintained by the TechShu AI team at Indus Net TechShu Digital Pvt. Ltd. for TechShu
> delivery teams. Changes normally come from inside TechShu — branch in this repository
> rather than forking. The repositories are public so colleagues can install without a
> GitHub account; outside issues and pull requests are welcome but are reviewed on
> TechShu's roadmap, not a community one.
>
> If you are a marketer rather than a developer, you do not need this document — see the
> README for installing and using the plugin.

Include:
- Plugin version (`plugin.json` → `version`)
- Claude Code version
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs. actual behavior

### Submitting Changes

1. Branch from `main` in this repository (TechShu staff), or fork it (outside contributors)
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/add-podcast-module`)
3. Make your changes following the conventions below
4. Test your changes (see Testing section)
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why

## Plugin File Conventions

### Skill Files (SKILL.md)

Every skill directory must contain a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: "One sentence describing when this skill should be used. Use when: ... (quote the description — it often contains colons)."
argument-hint: "[primary-input --option1 --option2]"
---

# /digital-marketing-pro:skill-name

## Purpose
What this skill does and what outcome the user gets.

## Input Required
What information the user must provide.

## Process
Numbered steps the skill follows. Step 1 must load brand context.

## Output
What the skill delivers.

## Agents Used
Which specialist agents are activated.
```

#### Skills that participate in the v3.0 engagement methodology

Skills that produce or consume engagement-state must add two extra frontmatter fields:

```yaml
engagement-part: "3"          # Which part this skill produces (1-12, or "orchestrator")
view-preference: v2-primary   # v1-only / v1-primary / v2-only / v2-primary / both
```

`view-preference` controls which version of source documents the skill loads:

- `v2-primary` — load v2 docs; fall back to v1 only if specific doc has no v2
- `v1-primary` — load v1 docs always
- `both` — load both v1 and v2 versions; the skill content compares them
- `v1-only` — load only v1 (used by ideation skills + Part 5 client validation)
- `v2-only` — load only v2 (used by execution-only skills)

These fields are **optional** for skills that do not participate in the engagement workflow. Existing v2.x skills continue to work without them.

For methodology skills, follow the conventions in Section 18 (the v3.0 Engagement Methodology Layer) of [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). The canonical examples are:

- `skills/engagement-workflow/SKILL.md`
- `skills/four-core-documents/SKILL.md`
- `skills/client-validation-document/SKILL.md`
- `skills/growth-plan/SKILL.md`
- `skills/yearly-planner/SKILL.md`
- `skills/continuous-improvement-loop/SKILL.md`

**Module skills** (16 core modules) must include a `## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)` section before `## Required Context`:

```markdown
## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)

Before producing any marketing output from this module:

1. **Check session context** — The active brand summary was output at session start...
2. **If you need the full profile**, read: `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`
3. **Apply brand voice** — Formality, energy, humor, authority levels...
4. **Check compliance** — Auto-apply rules for brand's target_markets...
5. **Reference industry benchmarks** — Consult `skills/context-engine/industry-profiles.md`...
6. **Use platform specs** — Reference `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md`...
7. **Check campaign history** — Run `python campaign-tracker.py --brand {slug} --action list-campaigns`...
8. **If no brand exists**, say: "No brand profile found. Use /digital-marketing-pro:brand-setup to create one..."

Do not ask the user for information that already exists in their brand profile.
```

**Command skills** (163 skills, 18 top-level commands) must have an explicit brand loading step as Process step 1:

```markdown
1. **Load brand context**: Read `~/.claude-marketing/brands/_active-brand.json` for the active slug, then load `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`. Apply brand voice, compliance rules for target markets (`skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`), and industry context. If no brand exists, ask: "Set up a brand first (/digital-marketing-pro:brand-setup)?" — or proceed with defaults.
```

### Agent Definitions (agents/*.md)

Each agent file uses YAML frontmatter and follows this structure:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: One sentence describing the agent's specialty.
---

# Agent Name

## Core Capabilities
Bulleted list of what this agent can do.

## Behavior Rules
Numbered rules the agent must follow. Rule 1 should always load brand context.

## Output Format
How the agent structures its responses.
```

**Key conventions:**
- Agents always load brand context first (Rule 1)
- Agents reference context-engine files for compliance, benchmarks, and specs
- Agents produce structured output (not freeform paragraphs)
- Agents state assumptions explicitly
- Agents include 5 additional sections: `## Tools` (scripts), `## MCP Integrations`, `## Memory Operations`, `## Reference Knowledge`, `## Collaboration` (inter-agent handoffs)

### Python Scripts (scripts/*.py)

Scripts must follow these conventions:

1. **Argparse CLI**: Use `argparse` for all command-line arguments
2. **JSON output**: Print structured JSON to stdout for programmatic consumption
3. **Graceful fallbacks**: If optional dependencies are missing, output a fallback JSON with `"fallback": true` and `sys.exit(0)` — never crash with `sys.exit(1)` on missing optional deps
4. **Brand-aware**: Accept `--brand SLUG` to load brand-specific data from `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/`
5. **No hardcoded paths**: Use `pathlib.Path.home() / ".claude-marketing"` for the data directory

Example graceful fallback:

```python
try:
    import nltk
except ImportError:
    print(json.dumps({
        "fallback": True,
        "error": "nltk_not_installed",
        "message": "NLTK not installed. Install with: pip install nltk",
        "recommendation": "Install NLTK for automated scoring, or review manually."
    }, indent=2))
    sys.exit(0)
```

### Reference Knowledge Files

Reference files in skill directories (e.g., `kpi-frameworks.md`, `compliance-rules.md`) should:

- Use structured markdown with clear headings and consistent formatting
- Include specific numbers, benchmarks, and thresholds (not vague guidance)
- Cite the source or basis for benchmarks where possible
- Be organized for both human reading and programmatic reference
- Use tables for comparative data
- Keep content current — update benchmarks annually

### Execution Command Skills

Execution commands (publishing, CRM, monitoring, communication) follow additional conventions beyond the standard command SKILL.md format:

1. **Approval step required**: Every execution command must include an explicit approval step before any external write operation. The process must include: "Present the execution plan to the user for review. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding."
2. **Risk level classification**: Execution commands must declare their risk level (low/medium/high/critical) and the corresponding approval requirements from `skills/context-engine/approval-framework.md`.
3. **Rollback documentation**: Commands that modify external state must describe what happens if execution fails and how to roll back.
4. **Platform verification**: Commands that write to MCP platforms must verify the correct platform connection is active before executing.
5. **Execution logging**: All execution commands must log results via `execution-tracker.py --action log-execution`.

### Memory Layer Conventions

When adding or modifying memory/knowledge commands:

1. **Layer selection**: Reference `skills/context-engine/memory-architecture.md` for which memory layer to use for each data type.
2. **Metadata requirements**: All stored items must include brand slug, timestamp, data type, and source.
3. **No raw credential storage**: Never store API keys, tokens, or secrets in memory layers.

### Agency Credential Conventions

When working with credential profiles:

1. **Credential profiles store references, not secrets**: `~/.claude-marketing/credentials/{slug}.json` maps brand slugs to environment variable names, never to actual credential values.
2. **Brand isolation**: Never allow operations that could leak one brand's credentials to another brand's context.
3. **Validation before execution**: Always validate credential profile completeness before attempting platform operations.

### Context Engine Reference Files

The 13 core reference files in `skills/context-engine/` are shared across all modules:

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `industry-profiles.md` | 22 industry profiles with benchmarks | Annually |
| `compliance-rules.md` | 16 geographic + 10 industry regulations | When laws change |
| `platform-specs.md` | 20+ platform character limits, specs | Quarterly |
| `scoring-rubrics.md` | 7 scoring frameworks (0-100 scale) | Rarely |
| `intelligence-layer.md` | Adaptive learning system docs | When architecture changes |
| `guidelines-framework.md` | Brand guidelines structure and enforcement | When guidelines system changes |
| `execution-workflows.md` | 8 execution type SOPs | When execution patterns change |
| `approval-framework.md` | 4 risk levels + industry gates | When approval rules change |
| `platform-publishing-specs.md` | Platform API write specs | Quarterly |
| `memory-architecture.md` | 5-layer memory system docs | When architecture changes |
| `crm-integration-guide.md` | CRM field mapping + sync patterns | When CRM integrations change |
| `agency-operations-guide.md` | Multi-client management patterns | When agency features change |
| `team-roles-framework.md` | Role definitions + permissions | When team features change |

When updating these files, ensure all modules that reference them still work correctly.

## Novel Feature Conventions

### Predictive Scripts

Predictive scripts (forecasting, simulation, scenario modeling) must:

1. **Use stdlib only**: Only `random`, `math`, and `statistics` from the Python standard library. No NumPy, SciPy, or pandas required.
2. **Monte Carlo defaults**: Simulations should default to **10,000 iterations**. Accept `--iterations` to override.
3. **Reproducibility**: Accept `--seed` for deterministic runs. When a seed is provided, call `random.seed(seed)` before any randomization. Document the default seed behavior (None = random) in the script's `--help` output.
4. **Output confidence intervals**: Results must include confidence intervals (e.g., p10/p50/p90) rather than single-point estimates.

### Intelligence Layer

All learnings stored by the intelligence layer must include these required fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `confidence` | float (0-1) | How confident the system is in this learning |
| `source_agent` | string | Which agent produced the learning |
| `conditions` | object | Context under which the learning applies (brand, channel, audience, etc.) |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | When the learning was recorded |
| `revalidation_date` | ISO 8601 | When the learning should be re-evaluated (default: 90 days) |

Learnings with `confidence < 0.3` must be flagged as hypotheses, not treated as established knowledge.

### Synthetic Audience

When generating synthetic audience data (panels, personas, simulated responses):

1. **Always include a confidence limitations disclaimer** in the output: "These are synthetic results generated from modeled assumptions, not empirical data. Treat as hypotheses for directional guidance, not as validated research."
2. **Synthetic results are hypotheses, not data**: Never present synthetic outputs as equivalent to real survey or analytics data. Label all synthetic outputs with `"synthetic": true` in JSON.
3. **Document assumptions**: List every assumption baked into the synthetic model (sample composition, response distributions, behavioral models).

### Self-Healing

Self-healing features (auto-corrections, automated fixes, adaptive adjustments) must follow these guardrails:

1. **All auto-corrections must be logged**: Every automated change must be recorded via `execution-tracker.py` with the original value, new value, reason, and timestamp.
2. **Reversible by default**: Every auto-correction must store enough state to undo it. Include a `--rollback` flag or equivalent mechanism.
3. **Configurable guardrails**: Auto-correction limits must be configurable (e.g., max budget adjustment percentage, max bid change per cycle). Defaults should be conservative. Never exceed guardrails without explicit user approval.
4. **Escalation threshold**: If a self-healing action would exceed the configured guardrail, escalate to the user instead of acting autonomously.

### GEO Monitoring

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) monitoring must use a consistent scoring rubric across all tools:

| Mention Type | Score | Definition |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Cited | **10** | Brand explicitly named as a source or recommendation |
| Mentioned | **7** | Brand named in a relevant context without direct endorsement |
| Concept-only | **3** | Brand's category or solution mentioned but brand not named |
| Absent | **0** | No mention of brand or relevant category |
| Misrepresented | **-5** | Brand mentioned with incorrect or damaging context |

All GEO scripts must use these exact values. Do not create alternative scoring scales.

## Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing

1. **Skill changes**: Run the modified skill command and verify output includes brand context, compliance checks, and proper formatting
2. **Script changes**: Run the script directly with `--brand test-brand` and verify JSON output
3. **Hook changes**: Validate `hooks.json` is valid JSON: `python -c "import json; json.load(open('hooks/hooks.json'))"`
4. **Reference file changes**: Verify no broken markdown formatting and that modules referencing the file still produce correct output

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] `hooks.json` is valid JSON
- [ ] All SKILL.md files have valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Scripts exit with code 0 (even on missing optional deps)
- [ ] Brand context loading path is explicit in all command skills
- [ ] No hardcoded file paths (use `~/.claude-marketing/` for data, `scripts/` for script calls)
- [ ] File count hasn't changed unexpectedly (currently ~530 files including docs)
