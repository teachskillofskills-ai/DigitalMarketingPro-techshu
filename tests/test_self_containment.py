"""Self-containment guard: no part of the plugin may delegate a capability to a
sibling plugin.

Rule (2026-07-12): each plugin in the suite is fully standalone. Cross-promotion
(links to the author's other repos, marketplace install lines, suite branding in
the shared-registry infra) is fine; capability delegation is not.

Shipped in v3.15.1 for skills/agents/commands; extended 2026-07-29 to cover
docs/, scripts/, and root docs after the full-repo audit found leaks the
original scope missed (docs/c2pa-production-cert-guide.md, AGENTS.md,
scripts/output-publisher.py, docs/engagement-methodology.md).
