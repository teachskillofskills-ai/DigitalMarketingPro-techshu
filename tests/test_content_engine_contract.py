"""Defects found by running the content engine end to end, not by reading it.

A full `brand-setup` → `content-engine` run on a fresh brand produced all twelve
working files and then surfaced a set of contract problems that no unit test
could see, because each one is about what an instruction MEANS rather than
whether code executes:

  * `brand_voice_match` asked for "<= 1.5 point deviation" while
    `brand-voice-scorer.py` emits `distance` bounded at 1.0 — read literally the
    gate could never fail. That is the same hollow-gate defect as a gate with no
    measurement behind it, and it had been sitting in the scorecard passing
    everything.
  * `seo_complete` required ">= 3 internal links" with no exemption. A
    pre-launch brand's first article cannot link internally to anything, so the
    gate was unsatisfiable rather than strict. Its "all images have alt text"
    criterion also passed vacuously at zero images.
  * `validate-profile` demanded `voice.*`, `target_jurisdictions` and
    `guardrails.*` as BLOCKERs, none of which `brand-setup` creates — so a
    freshly created brand failed the plugin's own validator. `content-engine`
    and `brand-voice-scorer.py` both read the generator's keys, which makes the
    validator the outlier.
  * The remediation message inverted its own diagnosis: copy scoring humor 0.00
    against a target of 0.20 was told it "reads as too serious" AND that the
    brand "calls for more serious tone". Following it moves the score further
    out of tolerance.
  * Two instructions both wrote to `05-scans.json`, one "save" and one "append";
    appending a second JSON document to a file holding one yields invalid JSON.

Stdlib only.
