# Digital Marketing Pro

> **Your agency just signed a 50-brand client. The previous agency left no playbook. Three brands are bleeding budget, two have stale positioning, one is launching in a regulated jurisdiction next month. Where do you start?**

Run `/digital-marketing-pro:engagement` against each brand. Same 12-Part Strategy Flow, same Four Core Documents, same 61-step structure — auditable across the entire portfolio in ~60 minutes per brand on Claude Opus-class models (measured on Opus 4.8; Opus 5 is the current equivalent at the same price). No more inconsistent depth between brands. No more "what did the last agency do?" mysteries. No more compliance gaps in regulated jurisdictions.

AI marketing plugin for TechShu delivery teams — **163 skills, 24 specialist agents, EU AI Act Article 50 ready, Cowork team-persistent**. Built for marketing agencies, in-house teams running 50–200 brands, and consultancies. Installs on **Claude Code** (CLI + IDE), **Anthropic Cowork**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Cursor 2.5+**, **GitHub Copilot CLI**, **Google Antigravity 2.0**, **Hermes Agent**, and **OpenClaw** + 35+ Agent Skills platforms.

> 🆕 **Just shipped — v3.31.1 (August 17, 2026): all five open community issues verified and fixed.** Every open GitHub issue was reproduced against the current release before touching anything — **all five were real**, and each fix ships with the guard that makes its regression class impossible: **(#10)** `claim-verifier.py`'s percentage pattern ended in `%\b`, which — because `%` is a non-word character — only matched when a word character *followed* the percent sign: `98%x` was a claim while "98% of customers" extracted nothing; fixed with `%(?!\w)` and pinned by a new CLI-level test suite. **(#11)** `keyword_cluster.py` tokenized with `[a-z0-9]+`, splitting every non-ASCII letter ("bürohaftpflicht" → "rohaftpflicht") — and exact-token Jaccard scored related German compounds at 0.00, blinding the cannibalisation gate and the link map in compounding languages; fixed with a Unicode tokenizer plus compound-aware similarity (containment matching with a 6-char floor; English sets score exactly as before, SERP-URL overlap stays pure Jaccard), pinned by tests including an English-parity bound. **(#13)** `engagement-workflow`'s frontmatter `allowed-tools` omitted `Task` while its body mandates Task dispatch in five Parts — on runtimes that enforce the declaration, the 12-part flow degraded; `Task` added, and a new guard fails any skill whose body references Task dispatch without declaring it. **(#12)** `plugin.yaml` (the one manifest outside the description guards) said "158 skills" for five releases; now 163, and the Hermes description joined the derived-count guard. **(#9)** `hooks/hooks.json` carried a `_readme` field that Cowork's plugin validation rejects — the rationale moved to `hooks/README.md`, the manifest is schema-clean, and a guard pins it (fixed across all three suite plugins, since every sibling shipped the same defect). Thanks to **@jurazerr** and **@theepicsaxguy** for precise, reproducible reports. 163 skills, 402 tests. Previously — **v3.31.0 (August 17, 2026): Grok (xAI Build CLI) becomes the ninth native platform.** A first-class `.grok-plugin/` manifest pair — `plugin.json` with the `"skills"` pointer Grok's loader reads, plus a single-plugin `marketplace.json` — makes `grok plugin install teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu` work directly ([Grok Build](https://docs.x.ai/build/features/skills-plugins-marketplaces) also reads the Claude Code manifests for compatibility; the native pair is what an official xAI marketplace listing points at). Both files are version-locked into the release-consistency suite. The same pass also caught and fixed four stale counts that had escaped the doc-count guard through new phrasings — "158 \`SKILL.md\` files" hidden by backticks, "158 marketing skills" and "158 DMP skill names" hidden by qualifier words, and an "All 209 tests" claim that was 170 stale — and taught the guard each phrasing, plant-checked, with "N tests" now a derived-truth noun. 163 skills, 381 tests. Previously — **v3.30.2 (August 16, 2026): the documentation truth pass.** A from-zero audit found the doc-count guard pattern-blind: the comparison table said "Skills count **158**" against 163 shipped, five documents quoted "86 Python scripts" against 93, and AGENTS.md — the file every non-Claude runtime auto-loads — pinned v3.17.0, thirteen releases stale. Every number is now re-derived from the filesystem and the guard grew the exact patterns that escaped it (script counts, SKILL.md-file counts, table rows, AGENTS.md currency), each plant-checked against the phrasing it previously missed. 163 skills, 379 tests. Previously — **v3.30.1 (August 16, 2026): richer Agent Plugins listing metadata + the directory submission bundle** (docs/distribution/). And — **v3.30.0: the content-engine run auditor — “status: ready” is now re-derived, never trusted.** New `scripts/run-audit.py` re-checks a finished run from its artifacts: every numbered artifact present, the humanize verdict **re-measured with a fresh `ai-tell-scan.py` run** instead of read off the scorecard, no scan JSON embedded in the file `authorship.py` measures (the corruption class that once flipped `may_claim_authored` and denied an author credit for work they did), the authorship record matching a fresh measurement, recorded voice distances actually inside the 0.15 gate, and publish-ready copy free of production placeholders. A scorecard declaring ready past its own recorded gate is a FAIL with the number quoted; a missing input is reported-N/A, never silent-pass. The content-engine contract now runs the audit before `status: ready` may be declared, and the verdict lands in `run-audit.json` beside the artifacts so the next reader sees the run was verified rather than believed. 163 skills, 376 tests. Previously — **Just shipped — v3.29.0 (August 16, 2026): Digital Marketing Pro travels in Agent Plugins 1.0.** OpenAI's vendor-neutral plugin standard (announced Aug 6; adopted by ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Kiro) reads a root `plugin.json` on a closed schema and defines `${PLUGIN_DATA}` as the persistent-data name — and a compliant non-Claude host previously resolved no data directory here at all, because every resolver read only the `CLAUDE_*` spellings. Shipped: the root manifest (version-synced with the Claude manifest and guarded by tests — closed-schema check, name rules, all 163 skills verified in the standard's layout), and `${PLUGIN_DATA}` accepted as the fallback wherever `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` was read. One listing in the shared ChatGPT + Codex directory is now a packaging step away rather than a port. 163 skills, 364 tests. Previously — **Just shipped — v3.28.0 (August 15, 2026): a `brand-setup` → `content-engine` run, following the instructions literally, found five defects no unit test could see.** **`brand_voice_match` was unfailable**: it asked for "≤ 1.5 point deviation" while the scorer emits `distance` bounded at 1.0 — a hollow gate that had been passing everything. Now stated in the scorer's own 0–1 unit at `distance` ≤ 0.15, the threshold the scorer already used internally, with a test that fails if the two diverge. **`seo_complete` held one impossible criterion and one vacuous one**: a pre-launch brand's first article cannot make 3 internal links, and "all images have alt text" passed at zero images — both now take an `N/A` that must name its reason, because a bare `N/A` is a FAIL. **`brand-setup` produced a profile its own `validate-profile` rejected** on BLOCKER items it never creates; the generator is the source of truth, so the validator was the outlier and now accepts its keys. **The voice remediation inverted its own diagnosis** — copy "too serious" was told the brand "calls for more serious tone", advice that moves the score further out of tolerance. And **creating a brand silently repointed every skill at it** with no history and no notice; it now announces the change, records the previous slug, and prints the way back. 163 skills, 358 tests. Previously — **Just shipped — v3.27.0 (August 15, 2026): the humanize gate got measured against writing that predates ChatGPT, and lost a signal that was pointing the wrong way.** A calibration corpus of **39 documents published before 2022-11-01** — before ChatGPT was public, so human authorship is guaranteed by publication date rather than assumed — across four registers, cut into **272 chunks of ~1000 words** so both classes are compared at equal length, against 18 documents of default model prose. Of the 45 words in the LLM-favored lexicon, **23 fired — every one only on the human class, none on the model class.** "robust", "facilitate" and "leverage" are ordinary technical English while current models have largely been trained off them, so as a **gating** signal it could only ever produce false positives; it is now advisory. And the gate now says what it actually proves: it fails **0 of 39** published human documents and catches **0 of 18** unedited model documents — a density floor, not evidence a piece was humanized. Also fixed: the content-engine told you to append scan output to `05-humanize.md` while `authorship.py` measured that same file — on a real run that moved `author_word_share` 0.253 → 0.206 and flipped `may_claim_authored` to false, denying an author credit for work they did. `violations` stayed clean throughout, which is why nothing caught it. 163 skills, 358 tests. Previously — **Just shipped — v3.26.2 (August 14, 2026): the humanize gate stops being a vibe, and the author stays in the piece.** The content-engine's `humanize_passed` gate asked for "AI-pattern density below the brand threshold (under 10% of paragraphs flagged)" while nothing in the repo defined what a flag was — no catalog, no agent, no script. A gate whose measurement is undefined does not fail; it passes on impression. **`scripts/ai-tell-scan.py`** is the missing definition: deterministic surface tells (LLM-favored vocabulary, **significance markers** like "here's the thing" / "that's the part that got me" — which are DELETED, never reworded — and soft-adverb clusters) with a real per-paragraph flag rate. Crucially it gates on only the tells precise enough to gate on: measured against hand-written copy, the short-declarative heuristic alone flagged half the paragraphs of a good piece, so connective openers, participial openers and ungrounded one-liners stay advisory — a gate that fails human writing is worse than the undefined one it replaced. **Bring your own words** (`--source-draft`): hand the pipeline your own rough draft and it builds the piece *around* your sentences — carried through verbatim, typos and all, exempt from every tell, with `scripts/authorship.py` verifying afterwards that nothing of yours was paraphrased or dropped. That check BLOCKS rather than advises, because a detector signal is a probabilistic opinion but "the author wrote this and it is gone" is a fact. When the record earns it (25% floor, zero violations) the disclosure becomes provenance-accurate — read off the record, never requested, so it can only ever understate human authorship. Plus **entity development** in the structural scan: specifics name-dropped once and abandoned, fixed by developing an existing verified fact — never by deleting specifics, never by inventing a mention. 163 skills, 358 tests. Previously — **v3.24.0 (August 12): the timing ladder.** Posting-time and send-time recommendations no longer come from static best-times tables. Both scripts now put the brand's OWN data first (`--history`: ranked windows with sample sizes and statistical floors — the only path to high confidence), keep the population tables only as dated, medium-capped test starting points that refuse when stale, and carry 2026 mechanics in every output (interest-ranked feeds reward early velocity but content strength dominates timing; per-recipient ESP send-time optimization beats any global window). Earlier today — **v3.23.0: capability-first translation.** The last hardcoded-vendor surface is gone: the language router no longer ships a "language family → product" table. It names what each family *requires* from a translation service (native script-aware models for Indic, formality registers for European, segmentation and variant control for CJK) and resolves a concrete service at run time — from the brand's recorded preference or the MCP servers you have actually connected — refusing with a resolution ladder rather than naming a product from memory. A vendor-neutrality guard keeps the instruction surface clean permanently. Also today — **v3.22.0: the Routing Layer.** All 163 skill descriptions rewritten to the trigger-dense house pattern — what the skill does and produces, the trigger phrases a user would actually type (slash alias first), and what it reads or pairs with — because the description is the only thing the model reads when routing a request across 163 skills. The rewrite doubled as an honesty audit: plan-only skills now say "it publishes nothing", every approval-gated execution skill names its gate, and overclaims in the old copy (a "launching, managing" orchestrator that only plans; a promised SLA document that is a terms outline) were corrected. A new density guard pins the pattern per skill plus a median floor so the surface cannot thin back out. Same day — **v3.21.x: the Flagship Contract.** Every market-priced figure in the repo now carries provenance: 28 benchmark docs live-verified and stamped, backed by a new `benchmark_book.py` (numbers enter only with a source URL + as-of date; stale quotes are refused, never reused) — the pass that caught WhatsApp's retired conversation-based billing and repriced tool tables. A machine-verified **depth contract** (`skills-index.json`) publishes what each of the 163 skills guarantees — 108 execute real scripts, 12 route through quality gates, 43 are structured guidance — with drift tests that fail if a skill's promises ever diverge from its machinery. Model resolution gains an execution ladder (`--for-execution`: provenance and registry age travel with every id; unknowns are refused, never guessed), `/digital-marketing-pro:help --intent` routes goals to skill *chains* instead of alphabetical lists, and a new end-to-end engagement smoke test proves the executable spine — intake → benchmarks → media math → campaign store — preserves provenance at every joint, on every release. Previously — **v3.18.0–v3.20.0 (August 12): the creator-craft wave.** Four strategy skills mined from creator-economy practice (`/goal-filter`, `/story-mine`, `/signal-mine`, `/lead-magnet-ideas`), `/video-packaging` with the title/thumbnail pairing principle, and video ad scripting wired into the house quality machinery (6s/15s/30s/UGC ad-format physics, campaign-context inheritance, every script through `/check`).

## Get started in 5 minutes (non-developer path)

**Are you a marketer, agency owner, or content lead who doesn't live in a terminal?** Here's the fastest path:

1. **Open [Anthropic Cowork](https://claude.com/cowork)** in your browser (no installation, no terminal, no command line). Sign up free if you don't have an account.
2. **Click your profile menu → Settings → Plugins → Add Marketplace.** Paste: `teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace`
3. **Find "Digital Marketing Pro" in the list → click Install.**
4. **Type in chat:** *"Let's set up a brand for ACME Corp"* — Claude will walk you through brand setup (voice, audience, jurisdiction, competitors).
5. **Then ask:** *"Run a full marketing engagement for ACME"* — and watch ~50–60 strategy documents get produced over the next ~60 minutes.

That's it. You never touched a command line. Your team Drive will hold the outputs. Re-open Cowork tomorrow and pick up where you left off.

**If you're more technical**, see [Quick start](#quick-start) below for the Claude Code CLI install (one terminal command).

**For team usage (agencies running 50+ brands)**, also run `/digital-marketing-pro:cowork-setup` once so brand state persists across Cowork sessions via your team's Google Drive.

## Why Digital Marketing Pro

Most AI marketing tools generate isolated outputs — a campaign brief here, an email there. No canonical sequence, no shared state, no enforced structure. Result: inconsistent depth, missed dependencies, outputs that don't compound.

**DM Pro runs every brand through the same 12 parts, producing the same files in the same order, with explicit dependency rules between them.** That's the whole product. Everything else — the 163 skills, 24 agents, May–June 2026 compliance updates, Cowork persistence — exists to make that 12-Part Flow ship cleanly across real marketing operations.

| What this gives you that ad-hoc prompts don't | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Canonical 12-Part Strategy Flow** producing the Four Core Documents (61 explicit steps) | Every engagement looks the same, so handoffs work and quality is auditable |
| **Two-Views Model** (v1 unbiased + v2 client-validated) | You never lose the original market view when the client pushes back |
| **Decision Matrix** — maps validation responses to re-runs | Stops over-running (wasted hours) and under-running (broken strategy) |
| **Living Project Instruction File** — single source of truth per engagement | All skills read it first; corrections propagate automatically |
| **EU AI Act Article 50 readiness** built in | C2PA provenance signing, deepfake disclosure, final Article 50 Guidelines + Code of Practice (10 June 2026) in compliance |
| **6-platform AEO/GEO audit** (incl. Google AI Mode) | The first marketing plugin to treat AI Mode as a distinct surface from AI Overviews |

---

## What you get in 60 minutes

Run `/digital-marketing-pro:engagement` and the plugin produces a full brand-strategy engagement in roughly 60 minutes on Opus 4.8/Opus 5-class models — **~50–60 canonical files** organized by part:

- **Part 1** — Stone-vs-Opinion intake (what the client knows for certain vs what they believe)
- **Part 2** — External market research (unbiased, no client docs)
- **Part 3** — Four Core Documents — 61 explicit steps across Business & SBU Analysis, Segmentation Framework, Brand Positioning & Communications, DMFlow
- **Part 4** — Competitive + Customer + Market analysis (4 unbiased docs)
- **Part 5** — Client Validation Document — the one true stop
- **Part 6** — Selective v2 re-runs per Decision Matrix
- **Part 7** — Preparation documents (campaign architecture, KPI tree, content pillars, approval chains)
- **Part 8** — **Growth Plan + 12-month Yearly Planner** (the flagship deliverable)
- **Part 9** — Channel-strategy fan-out (up to 17 channel docs in 7 families)
- **Part 10** — Execution artefacts (ad copy, post copy, headlines, CTAs)
- **Part 11** — AI creative briefs (with Nano Banana Pro / Veo 3.1 / Gemini Omni model guidance and C2PA + deepfake-disclosure clauses)
- **Part 12** — Continuous improvement loop

Cost: roughly **$15–40 in Claude API spend** for a full 12-part engagement using Opus 4.8 or Opus 5 (same $5/$25 per-MTok pricing). The plugin itself is MIT-licensed and free.

## Quick start

### 1. Install on Claude Code (canonical)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace
/plugin install digital-marketing-pro@techshu
```

`/plugin` commands work in **Claude Code** (CLI + IDE at [claude.com/code](https://claude.com/code)) and **Anthropic Cowork**. In the standard Claude chat app (browser `claude.ai` OR the installed Claude Desktop app) plugins still install and run, but management is via the **Plugins** UI button at the bottom of the chat — not via `/plugin` slash commands. See the [Updating](#updating) section for the recovery procedure if you accidentally try a slash command in the chat UI.

### 2. Turn on auto-update (recommended)

Third-party marketplaces have auto-update **OFF by default** in Claude Code — no banner tells you when a new version ships. Fix it once:

Open `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** tab → find `techshu` → toggle **Enable auto-update**. Done — future releases pull at session start; `/reload-plugins` applies mid-session without restart.

### 3. Set up your first brand

```
/digital-marketing-pro:brand-setup
```

Interactive brand profiling — voice, audience, channels, industry, target jurisdictions, competitors, goals. Quick mode (5 questions) or full mode (17 questions). Optional: `/digital-marketing-pro:import-guidelines` to bulk-load existing brand guidelines, SOPs, or templates.

### 4. Run a full engagement, or jump straight to a workflow

```
/digital-marketing-pro:engagement           # full 12-Part Strategy Flow (~60 min)
```

Or jump straight to one workflow:

```
/digital-marketing-pro:campaign-plan        # multi-channel campaign with budget, timeline, KPIs
/digital-marketing-pro:seo-audit            # technical + content + E-E-A-T + AI visibility audit
/digital-marketing-pro:content-engine       # blog / ad / email / social / landing / video drafts
/digital-marketing-pro:competitor-analysis  # multi-dimensional deep-dive
/digital-marketing-pro:performance-report   # trends + anomalies + recommendations
/digital-marketing-pro:email-sequence       # subject lines, copy, timing, segmentation
/digital-marketing-pro:check                # pre-publish quality gate (hallucination + voice + claims)
/digital-marketing-pro:status               # unified brand snapshot
/digital-marketing-pro:resume               # resume an interrupted long workflow (engagement / campaign-plan / etc.)
/digital-marketing-pro:output-folder        # open the user-visible ~/Documents/DigitalMarketingPro/ folder
```

## Real workflows you'd actually run

### 🆕 New-client onboarding (agency, week 1)
```
/digital-marketing-pro:brand-setup "ACME Corp"        # interactive: voice, audience, channels, jurisdiction
/digital-marketing-pro:competitor-analysis            # multi-dimensional deep-dive on top 5 competitors
/digital-marketing-pro:engagement                     # full 12-Part Strategy Flow (~60 min on Opus-class)
/digital-marketing-pro:check  engagements/.../03-four-core/*.md   # pre-publish gate before client review
```
Output: ~50–60 canonical files. Cost: $15–40 in API spend. Time saved: ~3 weeks of senior-strategist labor.

### 📊 Quarterly business review (in-house, last week of quarter)
```
/digital-marketing-pro:performance-report   --period=Q2-2026
/digital-marketing-pro:attribution-report   --period=Q2-2026 --model=data-driven
/digital-marketing-pro:competitor-monitor   --since=2026-04-01

| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `copilot plugin marketplace add teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace` then `copilot plugin install digital-marketing-pro@techshu` | `.github/plugin/plugin.json` (Copilot CLI also recognizes `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as fallback) | Full skills + MCP support; subagents need `.agent.md` extension (open issue); custom slash commands not yet supported in Copilot CLI |
| **Google Antigravity 2.0** CLI + IDE | `agy plugin install https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu` | `gemini-extension.json` (at repo root, per Google's reference pattern) | Full skills + hooks support; subagents need `/agent` CLI spawning; slash commands fold into skills via `agy plugin import gemini` |
| **Hermes Agent** (Nous Research) — Desktop + CLI on macOS / Windows / Linux | `hermes plugins install teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu` | `plugin.yaml` + `__init__.py` at repo root (Hermes native spec) | Native plugin — adapter walks `skills/` at register time and exposes all 163 skills via `ctx.register_skill()`. Targets Hermes Desktop v0.15.2+ (public preview June 2 2026). |
| **OpenClaw** (formerly Clawdbot / Moltbot) | `openclaw plugins install git:github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu` | `openclaw.plugin.json` at repo root (also auto-detects `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as Claude-compatible bundle) | Native plugin via `openclaw.plugin.json`; `skills` field points at `./skills`. Also installable via ClawHub marketplace (submission pending). |
| **Grok** (xAI Build CLI) | `grok plugin install teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu` — or `grok plugin marketplace add teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace` then `grok plugin install digital-marketing-pro` (append `--trust` to skip the install confirmation) | `.grok-plugin/plugin.json` + `.grok-plugin/marketplace.json` ([Grok Build](https://docs.x.ai/build/features/skills-plugins-marketplaces) also reads the Claude Code manifests for compatibility; the native pair is the first-class lane) | Full skills support |

**Why this works:** Agent Skills became an open standard in December 2025 (donated to the Agentic AI Foundation; adopted by **41+ agent products** by June 2026 — see ["Works on 40+ agent harnesses"](#works-on-40-agent-harnesses-via-the-agent-skills-open-standard) below). All 163 SKILL.md files in DM Pro are platform-portable as written. The sibling manifests are thin platform-specific wrappers around the same `skills/` directory — no skill duplication, no maintenance fork. The pattern is borrowed from Google's reference repo [`gemini-cli-extensions/data-agent-kit-starter-pack`](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/data-agent-kit-starter-pack).

**Minimum Claude Code version: 2.1.157** (declared via `requiredMinimumVersion` in plugin.json — landed in Claude Code v2.1.163, June 4 2026). Older Claude Code builds will be told to upgrade rather than load DMP with missing features.

## Works on 40+ agent harnesses (via the Agent Skills open standard)

Beyond the 9 surfaces above where we ship a native manifest, DMP's 163 SKILL.md files work out-of-the-box on any agent that adopted the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) (Anthropic-published Dec 2025, 41+ adopters as of June 2026). On each platform below, point it at our `skills/` folder and all 163 marketing skills are immediately discoverable. No platform-specific manifest needed.

**Quick test on any Tier-1 platform:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the skills folder (or point your platform at the GitHub raw URL)
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu.git
# 2. Point your agent's skills-config at ./digital-marketing-pro/skills
# 3. Try: "Run a competitor analysis on stripe.com"
# Your agent picks /digital-marketing-pro:competitor-analysis automatically.
```

**Why we don't ship per-platform manifests for these:** the Agent Skills standard says agents discover by walking a directory tree for `SKILL.md` files — no manifest required. Shipping 35 extra wrapper manifests would create maintenance overhead with zero added value.

If you run into a platform-specific install snag, file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu/issues) — we'll add platform-specific docs as users report patterns.

## The 12-Part Engagement Methodology

| Part | Name | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Client Inputs | Stone vs Opinion intake (what client knows for certain vs what they believe) |
| 2 | External Research | Unbiased market research (no client docs used) |
| 3 | **Four Core Documents** | 61 explicit steps — Business & SBU (18), Segmentation (15), Brand Positioning (19), DMFlow (9) |
| 4 | Competitive + Customer + Market | 4 unbiased analysis documents (4.1–4.4) |
| 5 | **Client Validation Document** | The one true stop — client accepts/rejects/edits each finding |
| 6 | Selective v2 Re-runs | Subset of Part 3 + Part 4 docs re-run per the Decision Matrix |
| 7 | Preparation Documents | Internal operating layer (campaign architecture, KPI tree, content pillars, asset inventory, approval chains) |
| 8 | **Growth Plan + Yearly Planner** | The flagship 11-section client-facing strategy + 12-month operational calendar |
| 9 | Channel Strategy Fan-out | Up to 17 channel docs grouped into 7 families |
| 10 | Execution Artefacts | Ad copy, post copy, headlines, CTAs |
| 11 | AI Creative Instructions | Visual asset briefs with C2PA + EU Article 50 clauses |
| 12 | **Continuous Improvement Loop** | Quarterly briefs feeding signals back into product/offering decisions |

**Key architectural concepts:**
- **Two-Views Model** — Every engagement carries v1 (unbiased market view) and v2 (client-validated view) after Part 5. Operating decisions reference v2; ideation references both. v1 is never deleted.
- **Stone vs Opinion** — Every fact captured at intake is tagged with confidence. Stone = client knows for certain. Opinion = client believes (becomes a research question, not ground truth).
- **Decision Matrix** — Maps client validation responses to which v1 documents need v2 re-runs. Prevents over- and under-re-running.
- **Update-Back Rule** — Live operations surface corrections → source documents get versioned (v2.1, v2.2 …) → Living Project Instruction File propagates the change to all downstream skills.
- **Living Project Instruction File** — Single source of truth per engagement. All skills read it first.

15+ strategic-framework reference documents in `skills/context-engine/` support the methodology (Five Digital Markets, Channel Families, In-Market vs Out-Market, Multi-Dimensional Decision Framework, Unit Economics, Actionable Persona Format, B2B Decision-Making Unit, Three-Scenario Forecasting, 30/60/90-Day Framework, Reporting Cadence, Fixed vs Variable Budget, Competitor 3-Question Output, India Market Context, and more).

## What's new

### v3.31.1 — all five open community issues verified and fixed (August 17, 2026)

Each open GitHub issue was reproduced against the current release; all five were real, and every fix shipped with its own guard. #10: the percent-claim regex only matched when a word character followed `%` — inverted behavior, now `%(?!\w)` with CLI-level tests. #11: the keyword tokenizer split non-ASCII letters and exact-token Jaccard scored German compounds at 0.00 — Unicode tokenizer + compound-aware similarity (English scoring provably unchanged). #13: `engagement-workflow` mandated Task dispatch its `allowed-tools` didn't declare — fixed plus a contract guard across all 163 skills. #12: `plugin.yaml` said "158 skills" — 163 now, with the Hermes description in the derived-count guard. #9: the `_readme` field in `hooks/hooks.json` failed Cowork validation — rationale moved to `hooks/README.md` in all three suite plugins, schema-clean manifests guarded. Credit: @jurazerr (4 reports), @theepicsaxguy (1 report).

### v3.31.0 — Grok becomes the ninth native platform (August 17, 2026)

A first-class `.grok-plugin/` manifest pair (`plugin.json` with the `"skills"` pointer Grok's loader reads + a single-plugin `marketplace.json`) makes `grok plugin install teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu` work directly; Grok also reads the Claude Code manifests for compatibility, but the native pair is what an official xAI marketplace listing points at. Both files are version-locked into `tests/test_release_consistency.py`, and Grok joins every platform-name guard (README troubleshooting, AGENTS.md surfaces line, install-command coverage). The same pass caught four stale counts that had escaped the doc-count guard through new phrasings — backticked `SKILL.md`, qualifier words ("marketing skills", "skill names"), and an unguarded "N tests" noun 170 stale — fixed the prose and taught the guard each phrasing, plant-checked.

### v3.30.2 — the documentation truth pass (August 16, 2026)

Every count in every live document re-derived from the filesystem: the comparison table said "Skills count 158" against 163 shipped, five documents quoted "86 Python scripts" against 93, and AGENTS.md pinned v3.17.0 — thirteen releases stale on the file every non-Claude runtime auto-loads. The doc-count guard grew the exact patterns that escaped it (script counts, SKILL.md-file counts, table rows, AGENTS.md currency), each plant-checked against the phrasing it previously missed.

### v3.30.1 — listing metadata + submission bundle (August 16, 2026)

Root `plugin.json` gains the official schema's full optional set; `docs/distribution/submission-bundle.md` carries the listing copy, starter prompts, and 5+3 test cases both official directories require.


### v3.30.0 — the content-engine run auditor (August 16, 2026)

`scripts/run-audit.py` re-derives a run's gate claims from the artifacts on disk: artifacts present, humanize re-measured fresh, no scan JSON inside the measured file, authorship record vs fresh measurement, voice distances inside the gate, publish-ready copy free of placeholders. The contract requires it before `status: ready`; exit 1 means fix the finding, never the wording.


### v3.29.0 — Agent Plugins 1.0 packaging (August 16, 2026)

OpenAI's vendor-neutral Agent Plugins standard (announced August 6; adopted by ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Kiro) reads a root `plugin.json` on a closed schema and defines `${PLUGIN_DATA}` as the persistent-data name. DMP now ships that manifest — version-synced with the Claude manifest and test-guarded — and accepts `${PLUGIN_DATA}` wherever `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` was read, so a compliant non-Claude host resolves a data directory instead of nothing. One listing in the shared ChatGPT + Codex plugin directory is now a packaging step away.


DM Pro is updated against the **actual current marketing ecosystem state** — the July 2026 market refresh (GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna, the Claude 5 family, the **final** EU AI Act Article 50 guidelines + Transparency Code of Practice), Google I/O 2026, the Google Ads v25 / Meta v25 API shifts, and the latest AI image/video model landscape. No "trained on 2024 data" surprises in your client outputs.

**v3.28.0 — Following the Instructions Literally (August 15)**

A brand-setup → content-engine run on a fresh brand, doing exactly what the skills said, surfaced five contract defects. `brand_voice_match` asked for "≤ 1.5 point deviation" against a scorer whose `distance` is bounded at 1.0 — unfailable, and quietly passing everything; it now uses the scorer's own 0–1 unit at 0.15, the threshold the script already flagged at. `seo_complete` demanded 3 internal links from a brand with no website and counted "all images have alt text" as passed at zero images; both now take an `N/A` that must name its reason, because a bare `N/A` becomes a way to skip any gate. `brand-setup` wrote a profile that `validate-profile` rejected on BLOCKERs it never creates — two other consumers read the generator's keys, so the validator was reconciled to reality. The voice scorer's remediation pointed the wrong way (content "too serious" told to be "more serious"). And creating a brand silently repointed the global active brand with no history; it now says so and prints the undo. Suite: 340 → 358.

**v3.27.0 — The Gate, Measured (August 15)**

A calibration corpus of 39 documents published before 2022-11-01 — before ChatGPT was public, so human authorship is guaranteed by publication date rather than assumed — across marketing blogs, personal and technical essays, journalism and institutional reports, and academic and standards prose. Cut into 272 chunks of ~1000 words so both classes are compared at equal length, against 18 documents of default model prose. Two findings. First, of the 45 words in the LLM-favored lexicon, 23 fired and **every one fired only on the human class** — "robust", "facilitate" and "leverage" are ordinary technical English while current models have largely been trained off them, so as a gating signal it could only ever produce false positives. It is now advisory. Second, the gate fails 0 of 39 published human documents and catches 0 of 18 unedited model documents: it is a density floor, not evidence a piece was humanized, and the docs now say so. Also fixed: the content-engine instructed appending scan output to `05-humanize.md` while `authorship.py` measured that same file — on a real run that moved `author_word_share` 0.253 → 0.206 and flipped `may_claim_authored` to false. `violations` stayed clean throughout, which is why nothing caught it. Suite: 335 → 340.

**v3.26.2 — Load-Test Corrections (August 14)**

A verification harness ran every script in the repo and an adversarial input battery against the text-processing surface. It found a real one: the authorship matcher was quadratic — 11.4s at 500 sentences, and its difflib prefilter pruned nothing in exactly the case that matters, because when the draft genuinely contains the author's sentences every pair looks promising. A long whitepaper would have hung the phase. Rewritten as two passes (hash index for verbatim survivors, fuzzy only over the remainder, with a mathematical length bound): 5000 sentences now match in 0.07s. Plus 28 adversarial inputs — empty, 50k words, RTL, CJK, null bytes, unclosed fences, HTML injection — all handled without a crash, pinned as regression tests. Suite: 331 → 335.

**v3.26.1 — Field-Test Corrections (August 14)**

Five probes run against the INSTALLED plugin. The gate held: DMP's own generated 1081-word article passes its own gate at 0% flagged paragraphs, a published human essay passes at 0%, and AI-shaped copy still fails at 66.7%. `entity_development` read OK on the real article (18 distinct entities, 1.67 mentions each) — the proxy behaves on genuine long-form content, not just synthetic fixtures. One real fix: the aphorism heuristic was flagging ordinary factual sentences ("The neighbouring region barely moved.") and rated both the human essay and DMP's own article HIGH. It now excludes context-dependent sentences (personal or anaphoric pronouns, coordinating-conjunction openers), and no longer contributes to `advisory_rating` at all — a signal too imprecise to gate on is too imprecise to headline a rating. Still counted and reported for the editor. Suite: 327 → 331.

**v3.26.0 — The Humanize Gate Stops Being a Vibe (August 14)**

The content-engine gated on "AI-pattern density below the brand threshold (under 10% of paragraphs flagged)" while nothing in the repo defined what a flag was — no catalog, no agent, no script. A gate whose measurement is undefined doesn't fail; it passes on impression. New `scripts/ai-tell-scan.py` is that missing measurement: deterministic surface tells (LLM-favored vocabulary, **significance markers** — sentences whose only job is to label what a neighbouring sentence means, like "here's the thing" or "that's the part that got me", which are **deleted, never reworded** — and soft-adverb clusters) with a real per-paragraph flag rate. It gates on only the three tells precise enough to gate on: measured against hand-written copy, the short-declarative heuristic alone flagged half the paragraphs of a good piece, so connective openers, participial openers and ungrounded one-liners stay advisory — a gate that fails human writing is worse than the undefined one it replaced. Absolute floors stop one legitimate "actually" in a short excerpt from normalizing into a tell. Plus **`--source-draft`**: bring your own rough draft and the pipeline builds around your sentences — carried verbatim, typos and all, exempt from every tell, with `scripts/authorship.py` blocking (not advising) if anything of yours was paraphrased or dropped, because "the author wrote this and it is gone" is a fact rather than a probability. The disclosure becomes provenance-accurate only when the record earns it (25% floor, zero violations), so it can only ever understate human authorship. And **entity development** joins the structural scan: specifics name-dropped once and abandoned, fixed by developing an existing verified fact — never by deleting specifics, never by inventing a mention. No watermark detection or removal — permanently. Suite: 294 → 327.

**v3.25.0 — Honest Provenance + the Structural Tier (August 13)**

Every brand profile gains an `ai_disclosure` block — author-optional, vendor-neutral default wording, three modes (`claude-surfaces` default with an uncertain-surface fail-safe that discloses rather than guesses / `always` / `off`) — applied by content-engine inside the publish-ready body so it survives publish-blog, recorded in handoff metadata either way, and classified by the new `detect_surface.py`. Plus the Tier-2 structural scan (`structural-tell-scan.py`, StoryScope-derived): moralizing closers, template symmetry, specificity density, stance absence, and uniform rhythm measured with spans; `/check` reports them as a pure advisory section, and the content-engine humanize step acts on them with fact-grounded structural edits. No watermark detection or removal — permanently. Suite: 281 → 294.

**v3.24.0 — The Timing Ladder (August 12)**

posting-time-analyzer and send-time-optimizer rebuilt from static best-times tables into the measurement ladder: the brand's own history first (`--history` — ranked day×hour windows with sample sizes and minimum-sample floors; the only path to high confidence), dated population baselines second (stamped, capped at medium `relative_strength`, warn >180d, refuse >540d), with 2026 platform mechanics in every output (early-velocity seeding, TikTok least time-sensitive; per-recipient ESP STO beats any global window, 5-15% current lift). Consumers updated; a phantom `--brand/--region` flag documented in team-roles-framework fixed to the real interface. Suite: 269 → 281.

**v3.23.0 — Capability-First Translation (August 12)**

The localization cluster's four-vendor routing table and closed service enum are gone. `language-router.py --action route` now returns a capability kind + selection criteria per language family and resolves a concrete service only from the brand's recorded preference or live-discovered connected MCP servers (`basis` on every payload); nothing connected → an explicit resolution ladder (the harness's own multilingual capability with mandatory quality scoring → already-connected tools → ask and record). Free-form preferences mean a server no shipped list knows still resolves. New guards: `test_language_router.py` + `test_vendor_neutrality.py` (no commercial translation vendor on the instruction surface, ever again). Suite: 253 → 269.

**v3.22.0 — The Routing Layer (August 12)**

All 163 skill descriptions rewritten to the trigger-dense pattern (what it does and produces → "Triggers on" with ≥4 real user phrases, namespaced slash alias first → what it reads/pairs with; median ~720 chars of routing signal), written against each full SKILL.md so nothing is claimed that the skill does not deliver — the pass caught and corrected real overclaims in the old one-liners. `tests/test_description_density.py` guards the floor per skill and the median across the surface. Suite: 248 → 253.

**v3.21.0 / v3.21.1 — The Flagship Contract (August 12)**

Benchmark provenance across the whole doc surface: 28 skill docs carrying market-priced figures (CPMs, CPCs, CPLs, creator rates, tool prices) were live-verified against 2026 sources and banner-stamped with an as-of date that *ages out in the test suite* — stamps older than 15 months fail the build. New `benchmark_book.py`: market benchmarks enter only via a recorded lookup with a source URL; fresh quotes cleanly, aging warns, stale refuses (exit 3). The verification pass caught real rot: WhatsApp's per-conversation billing (retired July 2025) rewritten to per-message reality, TikTok TopView CPM corrected $50–$80 → $11–$19, Heepsy/Modash repriced. New machine-verified depth contract: `skills-index.json` publishes every skill's tier (E executes scripts / M measured via gates / G guided — currently 108/12/43) with drift + broken-reference + tier-floor guards. `resolve_model.py --for-execution` attaches basis + registry age to every resolution and refuses unknowns. `/help --intent "<goal>"` routes to gated skill chains. A new engagement capstone smoke test runs a synthetic brand through intake → benchmark record/quote → ROI math → campaign persistence and asserts the benchmark's source URL survives every joint. Suite: 212 → 248 tests. (v3.21.1, same day: index byte counts newline-normalized so the drift check compares content, never checkout line-ending config — caught by the verify-from-installed-copy ship step.)

**v3.18.0 – v3.20.0 — The creator-craft wave (August 12)**

Three releases in one day, quarried from a 17-skill creator-economy reference library. v3.18.0: four new strategy skills — `/goal-filter` (one goal per brand, honest ON/PARTIAL/OFF verdicts), `/story-mine`, `/signal-mine` (authority beats relevance), `/lead-magnet-ideas` (power×effort grading). v3.19.0: `/video-packaging` (title = keywords for the algorithm, thumbnail = tension for the human, never echo — checked word by word), discovery-intent tags, the payoff rule (no scene ends on setup), retention notes, and the standalone test with shipped cut-lists in content-repurpose (163 skills). v3.20.0: video ad scripting wired into the house quality machinery — organic-vs-ad detection with campaign-context inheritance, ad-format physics (6s bumper, 15s skippable where the 5-second skip button is the real deadline, 30s front-loaded arc, UGC-style as style not disclosure exemption), and every script routed through `/check` before delivery.

**v3.17.1 — Registry reconciliation + anonymity guard (July 30)**

Balanced/fast model aliases re-pointed to the current generation (claude-sonnet-5, gpt-5.6-terra, gpt-5.6-luna); GPT-5.5/5.4 family marked `supported` with `replacement_id`s targeting GPT-5.6; `balanced-video` tier added. New `tests/test_source_anonymity.py` machine-enforces the never-name-the-source-organization rule (needles assembled at runtime; verified to fire on a planted probe). Suite: 210 tests.

**v3.17.0 — The Line-by-Line Audit (July 29)**

Full-repo audit: 16 parallel readers covered 100% of the repo's files line-by-line, cross-checked against primary-source July-2026 facts and against the code itself. Highlights: every doc↔script contract verified (payload shapes, flags, thresholds, storage paths); dead products removed from recommendations; EU Code/Article 50 language moved fully to final-Code, post-deadline state; scripts hardened (trustworthy exit codes, atomic writes, real quality gates, input sanitization); reference-file indexes completed so all 169 reference docs are discoverable; self-containment guard now covers the entire repo. Suite: 209 tests.

**v3.16.0 — July Market Refresh (July 12)**
Everything verified against primary sources on ship day. The **final EU Code of Practice on Transparency of AI-Generated Content** (10 June 2026) replaces all second-draft guidance in the compliance docs — standardized EU disclosure icons are live, the initial-signatory window closed **22 July 2026** (late signing remains possible), and the final Article 50 Guidelines are in (`compliance-rules.md`). The model registry adds the **Claude 5 family** (`claude-fable-5` with refusal/fallback semantics, `claude-opus-5` — the new `latest-text-anthropic`, `claude-sonnet-5`) and **GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna** (`latest-text-openai` → Sol), flags Opus 4.1's Aug 5 retirement, and is mirrored to the shared suite registry. Paid docs get the **Meta v25 truth pass** (standalone Advantage+ Shopping/App creation blocked via API — unified Advantage+ documented as the go-forward path; Page Viewer metric replaces legacy reach) plus Google Ads v25 breaking changes and LinkedIn 202607. `gsc-ai-performance` adds the Discover generative surfaces. README claims rotated to the current model lineup.

**v3.15.1 — Self-containment patch (July 12)**
Removed every cross-plugin capability reference from the skill surface: `ad-creative` and the engagement's Part 11 hand visual production to your own tooling (design team, AI generators, or connected design platforms) instead of naming a sibling plugin; `launch-campaign` C2PA signing and checkpoint-resume route through DMP's own `c2pa-metadata` and `/digital-marketing-pro:resume`; `validate-profile` checks DMP's own publish dir (`$DIGITAL_MARKETING_PRO_PUBLISH_DIR` / `~/Documents/DigitalMarketingPro/`); the EU compliance reference docs are DMP-centric. DMP is fully standalone — no other plugin is ever required for any documented capability. Cross-promo links in this README stay; capability delegation is gone.

**v3.15.0 — Reliability & Truth (July 7)**
A full-repo audit (orchestration, agents, skills, scripts, docs/manifests) surfaced ~200 findings, all fixed in one pass. One shared workspace-root/slugify/atomic-write helper (`_common.py`) ends the storage split-brain; connectors are honestly opt-in (the shipped `.mcp.json` is empty, fictional npm packages purged, memory backends demoted to "only if connected"); all 18 execution skills carry a uniform `## Execution gate` and flip to `disable-model-invocation: false` (**closes issue #6**); the Tessl workflow moves to the `tessl review` CLI + `.github/tessl-rubric.yml` (**closes issue #8**); `competitor-intelligence` merges into `competitive-intel` (**25 → 24 agents**); `embed-c2pa.py` gains the EU AI Act Article 50 `--ai-disclosure` assertion; and a new `check_skill_contracts.py` doc-vs-argparse linter + state-layer tests grow the suite **123 → 207 passing**. Every fabricated capability, stale count, and phantom flag is fixed or labeled.

**v3.14.1 — README sync + test-infra extension (June 28)**
Patch release fixing 4 stale references in this README that escaped the v3.14.0 ship: the Cowork badge anchor, the `## Supported surfaces` heading, a second internal anchor, and the missing v3.13.1 + v3.14.0 entries in this very section. Plus extended `tests/test_release_consistency.py` to lock the Supported-surfaces heading to the canonical version + verify all anchor links to `#supported-surfaces-v…` match — so this drift class can never reach a release again. No runtime change.

**v3.14.0 — June 2026 market-refresh sweep (June 28)**
Comprehensive ecosystem-change audit against primary vendor docs. Every claim verified against Anthropic / OpenAI / Google AI / Google Ads / EU Commission primary sources before any code change.

- **Meta Graph API bumped v20.0 → v24.0** in `scripts/connector_resolver.py` (4 callsites). All pre-v24 Meta Marketing API calls were scheduled to fail 2026-06-09 — our v20 hits would have started returning HTTP 400/410. Affected: campaigns / posts / feed / campaign-updates endpoints.
- **Model registry rebuilt to 47 entries** verified against [platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations), [developers.openai.com](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/deprecations), [ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/deprecations](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/deprecations). New active flagships: **Claude Opus 4.8** (now Anthropic's recommended), **GPT-5.5 family**, **gpt-image-2**, **Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview**, **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite**, **Veo 3.1 Preview**, **Nano Banana Pro (GA gemini-3-pro-image)**, **Nano Banana 2 (GA gemini-3.1-flash-image with video-to-image)**. Newly deprecated: **full GPT-5 family** + **o3 family** (shutdown 2026-12-11), **Gemini 2.5 family** (shutdown 2026-10-16), **Imagen 4** (2026-06-15). Newly retired and routed to replacements automatically: **Gemini 2.0 family** (shutdown 2026-06-01), **Gemini 3 preview image variants** (shutdown 2026-06-25), **Veo 2.0/3.0/3.0-Fast** (shutdown 2026-06-30).
- **Resolver now auto-rewrites `retired` model IDs** to their `replacement_id` unconditionally (was previously only `deprecated` status). Means cached config pointing at dead model IDs gets routed to a working replacement instead of HTTP 404. New test `test_retired_falls_forward_unconditionally` covers this.
- **`python scripts/resolve_model.py --check-params <file>` scanner** flags any Python file passing `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` near Claude Opus 4.7+ targets (those return HTTP 400). Pre-flight scan of all 3 plugins' `scripts/*.py` was clean.
- **18 aliases re-pointed.** `latest-text-anthropic` → claude-opus-4-8, `latest-text-openai` → gpt-5.5, `latest-image-photoreal-google` → gemini-3-pro-image (Imagen 4 was deprecated path), `latest-video-google` → veo-3.1-generate-preview, `latest-image-google` → gemini-3-pro-image (was retired preview ID).
- **Google Ads API v24.1 + v24.2 documented** in `skills/paid-advertising/google-ads.md`. v24.1 added 4 new experiment types (`ADOPT_AI_MAX`, `ADOPT_BROAD_MATCH_KEYWORDS`, `OPTIMIZE_ASSETS`, `PMAX_REPLACEMENT_SHOPPING`) + `mobile_device_platform` segment. v24.2 added `GENERATE_LANDING_PAGE_TEXT` asset automation + first-class Local Services Ads (`AssetGroup.google_local_services_info`) + beta `MultiPartyAuthReview` for regulated verticals.
- **EU AI Act Code of Practice second-draft refresh** in `skills/context-engine/eu-code-of-practice.md`. Section 1 (Providers) now consolidates around two-layered marking (secured metadata required + watermarking required); C2PA explicitly satisfies the metadata layer. Section 2 (Deployers) dropped the AI-generated-vs-AI-assisted taxonomy entirely in favor of design + placement requirements for icons/labels/disclaimers on deepfakes + text publications on matters of public interest. Added operational readiness checklist for 2026-08-02 Article 50 applicability date.
- **Google I/O 2026 additions**: `skills/aeo-audit/SKILL.md` adds callout for **Google Information Agents** (AI Pro/Ultra subscriber feature launching summer 2026) as future 7th probe target alongside ChatGPT/Perplexity/AI Mode/AI Overviews/Gemini/Copilot. `skills/local-seo/SKILL.md` adds **2026 priority section** for Google **Agentic Booking expansion** to local services / home repair / beauty / pet care with three opt-in requirements (GBP scheduling integration, `AvailabilityFeed` structured data, Service-catalog price transparency).
- **EvoLink vendor support** added to model curator (via community PR merged during this release): multi-provider API gateway aggregating DeepSeek/Doubao/MiniMax through a single API key. 3 new aliases (`latest-text-evolink`, `latest-balanced-evolink`, `latest-fast-evolink`).
- **`docs/MODEL-CURATOR.md` refresh** with current alias resolutions + new § "Parameter compatibility — Claude Opus 4.7 and later" explaining the HTTP 400 risk.

Test count: 114 → **120**. Native platforms unchanged at 8.

**v3.13.1 — Test infrastructure hardening + user-friendliness polish (June 9)**
Triggered by user push-back: "you have the testing infrastructure, so test everything properly and make sure everything works awesomely."

- **Tests expanded 70 → 114** with three new test modules: `test_release_consistency.py` (25 tests) catches version drift / README badge staleness / CHANGELOG out-of-sync / install commands going missing / critical sections going missing / broken anchor links; `test_hermes_edge_cases.py` (10 tests) for adapter resilience under bad ctx / None / SDK surface drift; plus assorted top-ups.
- **Troubleshooting section** added to README covering common install issues for all 8 native platforms (Claude Code / Cowork / Codex / Cursor / Copilot CLI / Antigravity / Hermes / OpenClaw).
- **5-minute non-developer install path** added to README for marketers who don't want to read 60K of docs to get started.

**v3.13.0 — Multi-harness expansion: native Hermes + OpenClaw + 40 Agent Skills platforms (June 9)**
Verified-real native manifests for two more agent harnesses, plus documented compatibility with 35 additional platforms via the Agent Skills open standard. Every claim verified against primary sources (the Hermes plugin docs at [hermes-agent.nousresearch.com](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/build-a-hermes-plugin), the OpenClaw manifest spec at [docs.openclaw.ai](https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/manifest), the Agent Skills client showcase at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)).

- **Hermes Agent (Nous Research)** — native plugin via `plugin.yaml` + `__init__.py` at repo root. The Python adapter walks our `skills/` directory at register-time and exposes all 158 marketing skills to Hermes via `ctx.register_skill()`. Defensive coding throughout — no Hermes runtime dependencies; uses stdlib only; degrades gracefully if the Hermes API surface differs from spec. Tested against Hermes Desktop v0.15.2 (public preview June 2 2026). Install: `hermes plugins install teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu`.
- **OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot / Moltbot)** — native manifest via `openclaw.plugin.json` at repo root. Points OpenClaw at `./skills` for direct discovery. OpenClaw also auto-detects our existing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as a Claude-compatible bundle, so the native manifest is for first-class discoverability + ClawHub marketplace eligibility. Install: `openclaw plugins install git:github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu`.
- **40+ Agent Skills platforms documented** — Goose (Block) · OpenHands · OpenCode · Junie (JetBrains) · Gemini CLI · Roo Code · Kiro · Amp · Letta · Mux (Coder) · Factory · Workshop · Tabnine · Mistral Vibe · Emdash · Superconductor · Ona · VT Code · Qodo · Piebald · Autohand Code CLI · pi · Command Code · TRAE (ByteDance) · Firebender · bub · fast-agent · nanobot (HKUDS) · Vita · Snowflake Cortex Code · Databricks Genie Code · Laravel Boost · Spring AI · Agentman · Google AI Edge Gallery. All read SKILL.md files from a directory tree — point any of them at our `skills/` folder and 158 marketing skills are immediately discoverable.
- **70-test stdlib suite** (up from 49) — 21 new tests cover the Hermes adapter (plugin.yaml schema validation, `__init__.py` import smoke test, `register(ctx)` against mock context with all 163 skills, graceful degradation when ctx surface differs from spec) and the OpenClaw manifest (id + configSchema required, skills field points at `./skills`, no hooks, no unexpected fields). Run with `python tests/run_all.py`.
- **Zero impact on existing platforms** — `plugin.yaml`, `__init__.py`, and `openclaw.plugin.json` are at the repo root but Claude Code only reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, Cowork only reads the same path, Codex only reads `.codex-plugin/`, etc. Each platform reads its own manifest path and ignores the others — same pattern that's been working since v3.8.0 (May 2026). `__init__.py` is never executed by Claude Code (it doesn't auto-execute Python files). MCP auto-connects, hooks, skill descriptions — none change.

Skill count: 158 unchanged. Test count: 49 → **70**. Native platforms: 6 → **8**. Documented Agent Skills coverage: 6 → **41+**.

**v3.12.0 — Cowork persistence, fallback models, model-freshness, tests (June 8)**
Research-grounded hardening pass. Verified GitHub issue [#51398](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/51398) — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` is NOT persistent across Anthropic Cowork sessions, contrary to the docs. Solution shipped:

- **New `/digital-marketing-pro:cowork-setup` skill + command.** Detects the Cowork sandbox, verifies a Drive MCP, creates the canonical Drive folder layout (`<root>/_brands/`, `_runs/`, `_plans/`), and persists the routing config so brand profiles survive across sessions. Uses a Drive-routing pattern that's been battle-tested with agency users. Includes multi-team isolation via per-team folder names.
- **`fallbackModel` ready out of the box.** `settings.json.example` ships with a 3-model resilience chain (Sonnet 4.7 → Sonnet 4.6 → Haiku 4.5) using the `fallbackModel` setting from Claude Code v2.1.152 (May 27 2026). When the primary model is overloaded or a non-retryable API error fires, Claude Code transparently swaps to the next model.
- **`requiredMinimumVersion: 2.1.157` declared.** Users on older Claude Code builds get a clear upgrade message instead of silent feature gaps. Landed in Claude Code v2.1.163 (June 4 2026).
- **Model-registry freshness check in `/digital-marketing-pro:doctor`.** Wires `resolve_model.registry_age_days()` into the doctor output. Severity bands: `ok` (<60 days), `warn` (60-119), `urgent` (>=120). When stale, the doctor prints the exact `refresh_models.py` invocation. Directly addresses "what if a new model drops between releases."
- **Cowork+Drive routing status in `/digital-marketing-pro:doctor`.** Reports `urgent` when Cowork is detected but `cowork-setup` hasn't run, so users see the brand-state-vanishes-at-session-end risk before it bites.
- **`disable-model-invocation: true` on 5 true side-effect commands** (`execute-action`, `cowork-setup`, `resume`, `check`, `output-folder`). Removes their descriptions from the model's listing — saves the per-session description budget and prevents Claude from auto-running them on a hunch.
- **Fixed 3 "Read all" eager-load anti-patterns** in `growth-plan`, `client-validation-document`, `continuous-improvement-loop`. Replaced with grep-first + targeted-Read patterns that respect the per-skill 5K-token auto-compaction budget.
- **Added Context efficiency callouts** to 3 more top-heaviest skills (`seo-plan`, `content-engine`, `analytics-insights`) — now 16 of the top-16 heaviest skills have explicit context-efficiency guidance.
- **CI line-count guard** (`scripts/skill-line-check.py`) keeps every SKILL.md under the documented 500-line guideline. Current state: heaviest is `four-core-documents` at 368 lines, all 163 skills under threshold.
- **Test suite (stdlib unittest, 49 tests)** covering `resolve_model.py`, `drive-sync-state.py`, `plugin-metadata.py`, `skill-line-check.py`, `connector_resolver.py`. Drive-sync tests run against a tempdir HOME so they never touch the real `~/.claude-marketing/`. Run with `python tests/run_all.py`.

Skill count: 157 → **158** (`cowork-setup` added). 192/192 skills still pass Codex `[a-z0-9-]+` regex.

**v3.10.0 — June 2026 platform refresh (June 4)**
Six discrete updates triggered by real platform changes April–early June 2026, every claim verified against primary sources:
- **New skill `/digital-marketing-pro:gsc-ai-performance`** for the Google Search Console **AI Performance Report** rolled out 3 June 2026 (UK first, combined AI Overviews + AI Mode impressions/pages/countries/devices/dates, no click data, new in-Search-Console opt-out toggle). New `scripts/gsc-ai-performance.py` reads exported CSV; API path returns "not yet supported by Google" with a recheck date stamp.
- **New reference doc** `skills/context-engine/eu-code-of-practice.md` for the **EU Code of Practice on AI-generated content** (page dated 22 May 2026, voluntary, WG1 providers + WG2 deployers, final code targeted May–June 2026, AI Act Article 50 applicable 2 August 2026).
- **`aeo-geo` + `aeo-audit`** updated with Google's official position — no `llms.txt` needed, no AI-specific schema needed, standard Search eligibility = AI Features eligibility (AI Optimization Guide updated 15 May 2026). Plus Google-Extended directive, AI Overview → AI Mode follow-up flow, Personal Intelligence to ~200 countries / 98 languages, AI Information Agents for AI Pro/Ultra summer 2026.
- **`c2pa-metadata`** — C2PA Content Credentials 2.3 (released 9 Feb 2026: live video, plain text, OGG Vorbis, large AVI, EXIF) + C2PA Spec 2.4 `c2pa.ai-disclosure` assertion (April 2026) for Article 50 deployer compliance.
- **`paid-advertising` + `google-ads.md`** — Google Ads API **v24** (22 April 2026) breaking changes: `videos`+`logo_images` mandatory in `DemandGenVideoResponsiveAdInfo` + `VideoResponsiveAdInfo`, `Campaign.video_brand_safety_suitability` moved to Customer level, `CallAd`/`CallAdInfo` removed. v23.1 added `text_guidelines.term_exclusions` + `messaging_restrictions` for AI-generated PMax/Search assets.
- **`analytics-insights` + `attribution-report`** — GA4 added **AI Assistant** default channel group on 13 May 2026 (`Medium=ai-assistant` for ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude referral traffic).

Skill count: 153 → **154**. 191/191 skills still pass Codex `[a-z0-9-]+` regex.

**v3.9.0 — Distribution & context-efficiency polish (May 27)**
Trimmed install-UI descriptions to ~150 chars across all 5 platform manifests + 4 marketplaces (was 600–2000 chars). Rewrote READMEs pain-first. Added platform-skill GitHub topics (`cursor-plugin`, `copilot-cli-plugin`, `gemini-cli-extension`, `google-antigravity`) for cross-platform discoverability. Inserted context-efficiency callouts in the 10 heaviest skills (grep-before-read, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` directory-list-before-open, offset+limit on partial reads).

**v3.8.0 — Real native manifests for 5 surfaces (May 27)**
Ships verified-real manifests for OpenAI Codex (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` per the published OpenAI schema), Google Antigravity 2.0 (`gemini-extension.json` at repo root per Google's `gemini-cli-extensions/data-agent-kit-starter-pack` reference), Cursor 2.5+ (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` per the verified Cursor JSON Schema), and GitHub Copilot CLI (`.github/plugin/plugin.json`; Copilot also recognizes `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as documented fallback). Adds `AGENTS.md` at root (auto-loaded by Codex + Antigravity + Copilot CLI + Cursor). All 157 skills share via the Agent Skills open standard — no duplication.

**v3.7.13 — Honest positioning (May 26)**
Removed the v3.6 / v3.7 era invented manifests for OpenAI Codex (`.codex-plugin/`), Cursor (`.cursor-plugin/`), GitHub Copilot CLI, and Google Antigravity 2.0 (`.antigravity/`). Research confirmed those manifests did not match the platforms' actual install specs (Antigravity uses `gemini-extension.json` at repo root; Codex schema we hand-rolled was invented). Supported surfaces are now accurately advertised as Claude Code + Cowork only. Multi-platform support is on the roadmap — research saved at `memory/`.

**v3.5.0 — May 2026 content modernisation (May 24)** — six discrete updates:
1. **Google AI Mode** added as a 6th first-class AEO/GEO surface (default conversational search since Google I/O on 19 May 2026, ~1B MAUs, Gemini 3.5 Flash backbone). AI Mode vs AI Overviews citations diverge 40–60% on the same query — audit both. `scripts/geo-tracker.py` PLATFORMS list now includes `ai-mode`.
2. **May 2026 broad core algorithm update** triage guidance — wait for rollout + 7–14 days settling before drawing conclusions; segment GSC data pre/in/post; Core Updates reweight existing signals, don't introduce new ones.
3. **EU AI Act Article 50 draft implementing guidelines** (8 May 2026; consultation closes 3 June; final guidelines July; enforcement 2 August 2026) — six-row clarification table covering "substantial AI manipulation", "matters of public interest", C2PA as presumption-of-compliance, deepfake visible disclosure, editorial-responsibility carve-out conditions, plus a five-point action list for brands with EU exposure.
4. **Meta platform updates** — Advantage+ Leads (global availability), Threads ads (global rollout, image-only), brand-safety inventory filters (Expanded/Moderate/Limited tiers with explicit reach cost).
5. **Gemini Omni + Nano Banana Pro + Veo 3.1** added to AI creative-brief skills with consistent C2PA-by-default and EU Article 50 disclosure clauses; influencer briefs ship with three explicit AI-tool clauses (permitted use, required platform disclosures, EU deepfake clause).
6. **Claude Code v2.1.149+ `/usage`** per-model breakdown integrated into `/digital-marketing-pro:agency-dashboard` for brand-attributable AI cost tracking.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history.

## How the SEO skills chain together

Most SEO work uses 3-5 skills in sequence rather than one mega-skill. The plugin is designed so that each skill produces numbered intermediate files (`01-...md`, `02-...md`, …, `PLAN.md`) under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/{brand}/seo/{workflow}/{date}/` — downstream skills read those numbered files, not the endpoint, so you can re-run any single step without redoing the whole chain.

**Agency onboarding workflow** (week 1 of a new client engagement):

```
1. /digital-marketing-pro:brand-setup
2. /digital-marketing-pro:competitor-analysis        ← picks the right competitors for everything downstream
3. Run all in parallel:
   /digital-marketing-pro:tech-seo-audit             ← baseline technical health
   /digital-marketing-pro:aeo-audit                  ← baseline AI visibility
   /digital-marketing-pro:backlink-gap               ← link prospects (needs competitors from step 2)
   /digital-marketing-pro:gsc-ai-performance         ← GSC AI Performance Report (3 Jun 2026)
4. /digital-marketing-pro:keyword-cluster            ← pillar+spokes architecture from aeo-audit content gaps
5. /digital-marketing-pro:seo-plan                   ← DISPATCHER — reads all of the above, scores 4 pillars,
                                                       the weakest pillar drives the lead theme of Q1's roadmap
```

**Quarterly review workflow:**

```
1. /digital-marketing-pro:gsc-ai-performance         ← fresh GSC AI export
2. /digital-marketing-pro:seo-drift                  ← compare this quarter vs last (auto-classifies gainers,
                                                       losers, reshuffles, new keys, lost keys)
3. Branch by finding:
   - High decline → /digital-marketing-pro:seo-audit + /digital-marketing-pro:content-decay-scan
   - High reshuffle → /digital-marketing-pro:aeo-geo (intent realignment)
   - High growth → /digital-marketing-pro:content-engine (amplification briefs)
4. /digital-marketing-pro:seo-plan                   ← re-run dispatcher with fresh inputs;
                                                       lead theme may shift to a different pillar
```

**Content production workflow:**

```
1. /digital-marketing-pro:keyword-cluster            ← from your seed list
2. /digital-marketing-pro:content-brief              ← per pillar from the cluster plan
3. /digital-marketing-pro:content-engine             ← drafts with brand voice + fact-check + humanize + SEO checklist
4. /digital-marketing-pro:check                      ← pre-publish gate (hallucination + brand voice + structure)
5. /digital-marketing-pro:publish-blog               ← push to CMS
6. /digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata              ← if EU markets are targeted and AI images accompany
```

**Backlink campaign workflow:**

```
1. /digital-marketing-pro:competitor-analysis
2. /digital-marketing-pro:backlink-gap               ← gap-vs-competitors with link-prospect priority scoring
3. /digital-marketing-pro:digital-pr                 ← consumes the prospect shortlist + outreach templates
4. /digital-marketing-pro:pr-pitch                   ← drafts individual pitches per prospect
```

Each skill has a **quality scorecard** that must pass before its `PLAN.md` is declared ready, and every heavy skill carries a **Tips & caveats** section with the common pitfalls. The `seo-plan` dispatcher uses **Confirm-Then-Dispatch** — it never silently re-runs expensive specialists, always asking explicitly with cost estimate before fanning out.

### 93 Python scripts (optional)
Plugin works fully without Python — all marketing knowledge, frameworks, agent capabilities, and skills work out of the box via the 169 reference knowledge files.

| Mode | Size | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge-only** (default) | 0 MB | All 163 skills + 24 agents + 169 reference files |
| **Lite** (`pip install nltk textstat`) | ~15 MB | Brand-voice scoring, content quality scoring, readability analysis |
| **Full** (`pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`) | ~50 MB | Competitor scraping, QR generation, AI visibility API checking, GEO tracking, C2PA signing |

### 14 HTTP MCP connectors
Notion · Slack · Canva · Figma · HubSpot · Amplitude · Ahrefs · SimilarWeb · Klaviyo · Google Calendar · Gmail · Stripe · Asana · Webflow

These are an **opt-in catalog** — the shipped `.mcp.json` is empty (`{"mcpServers":{}}`), so nothing auto-connects; enable only the ones you need. All HTTP, all Cowork-compatible. For services without first-party HTTP MCPs (Google Sheets, Drive, Salesforce, etc.), see `.mcp.json.connectors-reference` for **Pipedream / Composio / Zapier / Make.com** aggregator paths.

For the extended stdio catalog (Google Ads, Meta Ads, GA4, GSC, Brevo, etc. via npx, Claude Code only — not Cowork-compatible; verify each npm package exists before use, npx runs remote code): `cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json`. See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) and [Integrations Guide](docs/integrations-guide.md).

## Resumable workflows + visible output folder (v3.7.7+)

Two user-team complaints from the v3.7.5 cycle drove this release: "dm pro is taking too long to process" (the 60-minute engagement that breaks midway loses 30+ minutes of work on restart) and the general "where did my 50 deliverable files save?" confusion (everything was landing under the Windows-hidden `~/.claude-marketing/` dotfolder).

**Fix 1 — Resumable workflows.** Every long-running DMP workflow now writes per-part checkpoints to disk so an interrupted session can resume from the next un-checkpointed part instead of restarting from Part 1. Covered workflows: `engagement` (12-Part Strategy Flow), `campaign-plan`, `content-engine`, `seo-audit`, `competitor-analysis`, `campaign-audit` (v3.7.5), `launch-campaign` (v3.7.5), plus a `custom` slot for any other long flow. Resume with:

```
/digital-marketing-pro:resume                              # auto-pick latest in-progress run
/digital-marketing-pro:resume engagement                   # filter to a workflow
/digital-marketing-pro:resume engagement <run-id>          # pick a specific run
```

**Fix 2 — Visible output folder.** Every artifact a workflow produces is now copied to TWO locations: the internal tracking copy under `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/output/{workflow}/...` (system-of-record), and a user-visible published copy under `~/Documents/DigitalMarketingPro/{brand}/{workflow}/{YYYY-MM}/{filename}` (visible in Windows Explorer / macOS Finder by default). Override the visible root with `DIGITAL_MARKETING_PRO_PUBLISH_DIR=/path` (e.g. a Dropbox share for the team). Reveal the folder any time with:

```
/digital-marketing-pro:output-folder                       # opens ~/Documents/DigitalMarketingPro/{brand}/
/digital-marketing-pro:output-folder <brand> <workflow>    # drill down
```

**Implementation:** `scripts/checkpoint-manager.py` (per-step storage + atomic writes, stdlib only) + `scripts/output-publisher.py` (dual-copy publish + `where` + `open` subcommands: internal tracking copy + user-visible published copy). The engagement/checkpoint state machine ships tests in `tests/test_engagement_state.py` + `tests/test_checkpoint_roundtrip.py`; a fuller 5-scenario end-to-end simulation (clean 12-part run / interrupt-resume / parallel workflows / quality-gate fail / all-workflows-accepted) was used during development but is a dev tool, not shipped in the repo.

---

## Connector-aware action resolver (v3.7.10+)

The `campaign-audit` and `launch-campaign` skills depend on 14 actions that map to real marketing APIs (Google Ads, Meta Marketing, LinkedIn, TikTok, HubSpot, Salesforce, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Customer.io, Gmail, Cision, Muckrack, Slack, Google Calendar, Ahrefs, Similarweb, SEMrush, Google Search Console). v3.7.5–v3.7.7 shipped these actions as honest stubs that always returned `status: stub_implementation` regardless of which connectors the user had. v3.7.10 introduces a resolver that probes the live state and resolves each action to one of three modes per call:

| mode | what it means |
|------|---------------|
| `real` | runs end-to-end with no external API (currently only `arm-watchdog` which writes a watchdog config to `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/watchdogs/`) |
| `manifest_ready` | a matching connector is configured — the response includes the exact HTTP request manifest (method, URL, headers, body template, auth pattern) for the orchestrator (Claude via MCP) to execute. Write/launch ops set `approval_required: true`. |
| `stub_unconfigured` | no matching connector is configured — the response includes the manual fallback PLUS copy-paste `.mcp.json` snippet, env-var list, and a Cowork-compatibility note |

Check what's live in your environment any time:

```
/digital-marketing-pro:doctor                              # full readiness table
/digital-marketing-pro:doctor --summary                    # one-line counts
/digital-marketing-pro:doctor --action inventory --channel google_ads  # drill in
```

**Test coverage:** the resolver's action layer ships tests in `tests/test_connector_resolver.py`. A fuller 27-scenario development harness (14 actions × unconfigured / configured / local-execution variants) was used while building this out, but it is a dev tool and is not shipped in the repo.

**Implementation:** `scripts/_connector_registry.py` (catalog of 33 connectors, 11 categories, `is_connector_configured()` probe) + `scripts/connector_resolver.py` (`ACTION_SPECS` map + per-action manifest builders + local executors) + `scripts/action-doctor.py` (the doctor command's underlying script).

### v3.7.11 — actions can actually fire HTTP requests from Python

The v3.7.10 resolver returned a manifest of "what would be sent." v3.7.11 adds `scripts/connector_executor.py` (stdlib `urllib.request`, no third-party deps) that takes that manifest and **actually executes** the request against the real API. Public CLI: `/digital-marketing-pro:execute-action`.

**Executes end-to-end from Python (8 connectors, verified vendor docs):**

| Connector | Env var | What it can fire |
|-----------|---------|---|
| Slack | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | `POST chat.postMessage` (with `body.ok` post-check) |
| HubSpot | `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` | `GET /automation/v4/flows`, `POST /marketing/v3/campaigns` |
| Klaviyo | `KLAVIYO_PRIVATE_KEY` | `GET /api/flows`, `PATCH /api/flows/{id}` (vnd.api+json) |
| SendGrid | `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | `POST /v3/mail/send` (202 success) |
| Brevo | `BREVO_API_KEY` | `POST /v3/smtp/email` (lowercase `api-key:` header) |
| Customer.io | `CUSTOMERIO_APP_API_KEY` | `POST /v1/send/email` (App API key only) |
| Mailchimp | `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` | `GET /3.0/automations` (Basic auth, dc from suffix) |
| Ahrefs | `AHREFS_API_KEY` | `GET /v3/site-explorer/metrics` |

**Requires the MCP path (25 OAuth-only connectors):** Google Ads, Meta Marketing, LinkedIn Marketing, LinkedIn Publishing, TikTok Ads, Twitter/X, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Meta Graph, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, Buffer, Hootsuite, Cision, Muckrack, Amplitude, Similarweb, SEMrush, Moz, Intercom, Canva, Figma. For all of these, the resolver still returns `manifest_ready` so you can see the exact HTTP shape Claude's MCP tool will send — Python just can't execute the OAuth flow itself.

**Safety gates:** read ops auto-execute with `--execute`; write ops require both `--execute --confirm`; missing env vars block with `setup_hint_credential`; unresolved `{VAR}` placeholders block before the request fires. Every fired call logs to `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/executions/`.

**Test coverage:** end-to-end HTTP send-and-receive for the 8 connectors (Slack `body.ok` post-check, Klaviyo vnd.api+json, Brevo lowercase header, Mailchimp Basic, plus the safety gates and data substitution) was validated during development against a stdlib `http.server` mock. That mock harness is a dev tool and is not shipped in the repo; the shipped suite covers the resolver layer via `tests/test_connector_resolver.py`.

## Model curator — no hardcoded model ids (v3.7.4+)

Frontier models change every ~6 weeks. Hardcoding `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` or `gemini-2.0-flash` across dozens of scripts means a provider deprecation silently 404s, the user blames the plugin, and the maintainer has to grep three repos. So we don't hardcode.

- **`scripts/model_registry.json`** — single source of truth for every model id used by the plugin, with vendor, tier, modality, status, and `replacement_id` for deprecated entries.
- **`scripts/resolve_model.py`** — Python module + CLI. Resolves human aliases (`latest-balanced-anthropic`, `latest-fast-anthropic`, `latest-text-openai`, `latest-vision-google`, `latest-image-google`, `latest-video-google`) to concrete ids at call time. Deprecated ids passed via `--model` auto-fall-forward to their replacement (with a stderr warning).
- **`scripts/refresh_models.py`** — polls Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / Evolink list endpoints with your API keys and reports drift versus the registry (NEW models in the provider catalog, STALE models in the registry).

Every script that calls a provider model now accepts `--model` (or `--openai-model` / `--anthropic-model` for `scripts/ai-visibility-checker.py`) and the value is validated against the registry. See [`docs/MODEL-CURATOR.md`](docs/MODEL-CURATOR.md) for the full alias map, curation policy, and worked examples.

```bash
python scripts/resolve_model.py --alias latest-balanced-anthropic    # -> claude-sonnet-4-6
python scripts/resolve_model.py --check gemini-2.0-flash              # -> retired (auto-routes to gemini-3.5-flash)
python scripts/resolve_model.py --list --vendor anthropic --status current
python scripts/refresh_models.py                                      # drift report (needs API keys)
```

## Compliance — 16 jurisdictions, EU AI Act Article 50 ready

DM Pro carries jurisdiction-specific compliance rules that auto-apply when a brand declares its target markets. Coverage:

🇪🇺 EU (GDPR + AI Act Article 50) · 🇺🇸 US Federal (CAN-SPAM) · 🇺🇸 California (CCPA/CPRA) · US 20+ state privacy laws · 🇨🇦 Canada (CASL + PIPEDA) · 🇧🇷 Brazil (LGPD) · 🇬🇧 UK (UK GDPR + PECR) · 🇦🇺 Australia (Privacy Act + Spam Act) · 🇸🇬 Singapore (PDPA) · 🇨🇳 China (PIPL) · 🇮🇳 India (DPDPA) · 🇯🇵 Japan (APPI) · 🇰🇷 South Korea (PIPA) · 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia (PDPL) · 🇦🇪 UAE (Federal Decree-Law No. 45) · 🇹🇭 Thailand (PDPA)

**EU AI Act Article 50 readiness (applicable 2 August 2026):**
- C2PA content-provenance signing via `/digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata` (end-to-end tested against c2pa-python 0.32 — 75-byte test PNG → 42,818-byte signed PNG with `manifest_embedded_and_verified=true`)
- Pre-publish gate (`/digital-marketing-pro:check`) treats missing C2PA on AI-flagged assets in EU campaigns as CRITICAL → BLOCKED
- Final Article 50 Guidelines + final Code of Practice on Transparency of AI-Generated Content (10 June 2026) in `compliance-rules.md` §1.1b.i with six-row clarification table + five-point action list
- Production cert guide at `docs/c2pa-production-cert-guide.md` covers the four CAI-recognised authorities (Adobe Content Credentials, Truepic, Numbers Protocol, Microsoft Azure Confidential Ledger)

**Other May 2026 regulatory updates baked in:**
- NY synthetic-performer disclosure law (live June 2026, $1K–$5K per violation, $10K repeat) — applies to synthetic influencers + AI endorsements
- FTC May 2026 endorsement guidance — synthetic influencers, AI testimonials, AI-edited creator content
- CJEU March 2026 ruling — pseudonymized cookie IDs are personal data when re-identification is feasible

## AEO / GEO — May 2026 reality

The search landscape pivoted hard in 2025–2026:
- Google AI Overviews appear on ~55% of all Google searches (Seer Interactive, Sept 2025); organic CTR on AI Overview queries dropped ~61% (1.76% → 0.61%); ~58% of Google searches are now zero-click
- **Google AI Mode** became the default conversational search experience for opted-in users at I/O 2026 (19 May 2026), backed by Gemini 3.5 Flash — ~1B MAUs
- ChatGPT search reaches ~883M MAU; Perplexity heavily skews citations to Reddit (47% of factual cites); Wikipedia drives 48% of ChatGPT citations

DM Pro's AEO/GEO skills (`/digital-marketing-pro:aeo-audit`, `:geo-monitor`, `:entity-audit`) reflect this:
- **6-platform audit standard** — ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Mode, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot (was 5 — AI Mode added May 2026)
- Schema strategy refresh — Google's March 2026 core update demoted FAQ/Review/HowTo schema on non-primary pages. Skills emphasise entity-rich JSON-LD (Article + Organization + Person + Product) and offer an optional **LLMs.txt** companion (Google states it is not required for AI-features eligibility)
- Citation tracking across all 6 surfaces, with Profound / Otterly / Conductor AgentStack integration paths in the connectors layer
- **Share of AI Voice** as a first-class metric in `/digital-marketing-pro:performance-report`

---

## Channel guidance — May 2026 updates baked in

- **LinkedIn (March 2026 algorithm shift):** external links and engagement bait penalized ~60%. New **Depth Score** measures dwell time. Followers no longer guarantee reach. Skills optimize for relevance and Depth Score.
- **Email:** Apple MPP affects ~64% of B2C opens — open rate is functionally dead as a primary KPI. **DMARC + RFC 8058 one-click POST unsubscribe** mandatory; non-compliant bulk mail to Gmail/Yahoo/Microsoft gets permanent 550 rejections. Spam threshold tightened to <0.10%.
- **TikTok (post Jan 22 2026 USDS Joint Venture closing):** US data + algorithm under USDS LLC; ByteDance retains <20%. AI-generated creators require disclosure label; AI content excluded from Creator Rewards Program; daily shoppable-post limits effective May 11 2026.
- **Meta Advantage+ Leads** (global as of May 2026), **Threads ads** (global, image-only), **brand-safety inventory tiers** (Expanded/Moderate/Limited — Limited costs ~30% reach).
- **WhatsApp** per-message pricing (since 1 July 2025) — India marketing template ≈ USD 0.0118 per message; 72-hour free service window from CTWA ads or Page CTAs.
- **Third-party cookies — deprecation cancelled.** First-party data is the strategic priority. The `attribution-model` skill defaults to first-party + MMM + incrementality stack.
- **Sora dependency note:** OpenAI consumer Sora app discontinued April 26 2026; Sora API September 24 2026. AI creative briefs default to **Veo 3.1, Kling v3.0 Pro, Runway Gen-4, Gemini Omni**.

## FAQ

**Q: How does this compare to LangChain marketing templates / CrewAI marketing crews / general AI marketing tools?**
Those are frameworks. DM Pro is a **packaged, opinionated methodology** with explicit dependency rules between every output. You can build something like it in LangChain or CrewAI — at the cost of months of engineering. DM Pro ships it.

**Q: Which Claude interface should I use?**

| | Claude Code | Claude Cowork | Claude Desktop (no Cowork) | claude.ai web |
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Full plugin support | yes | yes | partial | no |
| Brand memory | yes | yes | no | no |
| MCP integrations | all | HTTP only | HTTP only | no |
| Document creation (Excel, PPT) | no | yes | no | no |
| Recommended for | Terminal workflows + scripting | Visual desktop workflows | Quick content | One-off questions |

**Q: How much does a full engagement cost in API spend?**
Roughly **$15–40** for a complete 12-part engagement using Opus 4.8 or Opus 5 (same pricing) across ~50–60 documents. Track per-brand consumption via Claude Code v2.1.149+ `/usage` (now integrated into `/digital-marketing-pro:agency-dashboard`).

**Q: Can I run multiple brands in parallel?**
Yes. Each brand has its own `~/.claude-marketing/<brand-slug>/` directory and Python script state. Switch with `/digital-marketing-pro:switch-brand`.

**Q: What if I only want a campaign plan, not the full methodology?**
Skip to `/digital-marketing-pro:campaign-plan`. Every individual surface (campaign / SEO / content / competitor / email / report) is independently runnable. The full engagement is the canonical path, not the only path.

**Q: Will this work on Codex / Cursor / Copilot CLI / Antigravity?**
Yes — verified-real native manifests ship for all 9 surfaces (CC, Cowork, Codex, Cursor, Copilot CLI, Antigravity, Hermes Agent, OpenClaw, Grok). See [Supported surfaces](#supported-surfaces-v3311) above for per-platform install commands.

**Q: I run my team on Anthropic Cowork. Does brand state persist between sessions?**
Yes — but you need to run `/digital-marketing-pro:cowork-setup` once per team first (v3.12.0). Cowork's per-session filesystem is ephemeral, and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` is too ([open issue #51398](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/51398)). The setup wizard routes brand profiles + plans + reports through a Google Drive MCP so everything survives across sessions and is shared across the team. Multi-team isolation via per-team folder names.

**Q: What happens when a new Claude / OpenAI / Google model ships? Do I need to update the plugin?**
No — the plugin uses a shared model curator (`scripts/resolve_model.py`) that resolves aliases (`latest-balanced-anthropic`, `latest-text-google`, etc.) at call time. When a model is deprecated, the curator auto-falls-forward to the replacement. `/digital-marketing-pro:doctor` reports registry age and severity (`ok` <60d / `warn` 60-119d / `urgent` ≥120d); when stale it prints the exact `python scripts/refresh_models.py` invocation to poll the provider APIs for drift. Plus `settings.json.example` ships a `fallbackModel` chain so Claude Code transparently swaps models on overload.

**Q: Is this an Anthropic product?**
No — an independent MIT-licensed plugin maintained by Indus Net TechShu Digital Pvt. Ltd. Runs on Claude Code + Cowork.

**Q: I found a compliance rule that looks out of date.**
[File an issue](https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu/issues) with the citation. Privacy and AI law change quarterly — DM Pro is actively maintained against the May 2026 reality but enforcement actions and amendments keep coming.

## Troubleshooting

Common install + first-run issues across all 9 supported platforms, with the fix.

### Claude Code + Cowork

**"/plugin isn't available in this environment"**
You're in the standard Claude chat app (browser `claude.ai` or the Claude Desktop app). The `/plugin` slash command only works in **Claude Code** (the dev CLI/IDE at [claude.com/code](https://claude.com/code)) and **Anthropic Cowork**. Everywhere else, plugins install via the UI: click the **Plugins** button at the bottom of the chat. See [Updating](#updating) for the full recovery procedure.

**"Plugin installed but slash commands not showing"**
Run `/reload-plugins` (Claude Code) or restart the Cowork chat session. If still missing, the installed version may be older than v2.1.157 — your Claude Code build needs to be on **v2.1.157 or newer** (DMP declares `requiredMinimumVersion: 2.1.157` in plugin.json). Run `claude --version` and update via `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.

**"Brand profile vanishes between Cowork sessions"**
Cowork's filesystem is per-session ephemeral — `~/.claude-marketing/` AND `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` both reset at session end ([open issue #51398](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/51398)). Fix: run `/digital-marketing-pro:cowork-setup` once per team — it routes brand state through a Google Drive MCP so profiles survive across sessions and your whole team sees them. See [v3.12.0 release notes](#whats-new) for the why-and-how.

**"`/digital-marketing-pro:doctor` says urgent (model registry stale)"**
The model registry hasn't been refreshed for 60+ days — frontier models shift every ~6 weeks so deprecated IDs may start 404-ing. Fix: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=... GEMINI_API_KEY=... EVOLINK_API_KEY=... python scripts/refresh_models.py`. The script polls each provider's `/v1/models` endpoint and reports drift versus our registry.

### OpenAI Codex / Cursor / GitHub Copilot CLI / Antigravity

**"Skills install but commands not discovered"**
These platforms read SKILL.md by description match — invoke via natural language (*"Run a competitor analysis on stripe.com"*) rather than typing a slash command. Slash commands (`/digital-marketing-pro:<name>`) are a Claude Code convention; on other surfaces the agent picks up the skill from intent.

**"Codex says skill name failed regex check"**
Codex enforces `[a-z0-9-]+` on skill names. All 163 DMP skill names pass this regex (verified in the test suite). If you see this error, it's likely a personal skill you added — rename it to lowercase + hyphens only.

**"Cursor `/add-plugin` returns 'plugin not found'"**
Use the full Git URL form: `/add-plugin digital-marketing-pro@https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu`. Cursor's marketplace integration is fastest, but the Git URL form always works.

### Hermes Agent

**"`hermes plugins install ...` finishes but no skills appear"**
The plugin needs to be enabled after install: `hermes plugins enable digital-marketing-pro`. Then verify with `hermes plugins list`. If the adapter's `register()` returned silently with no skills, run the audit: `cd ~/.hermes/plugins/digital-marketing-pro && python __init__.py` — it'll print the discovered skill count + the first five skills, confirming the clone got the full `skills/` tree.

**"register_skill error in Hermes logs"**
Check Hermes version: this plugin targets **v0.15.2+**. Run `hermes --version`. Older builds may have a different `ctx` API surface — the adapter degrades gracefully (logs an error, doesn't crash) but won't register skills. Upgrade Hermes to the latest public preview.

### OpenClaw

**"OpenClaw can't find the plugin manifest"**
Use the `git:` install scheme: `openclaw plugins install git:github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu`. If you used another scheme and it failed, the fallback is: `cd ~/.openclaw/plugins && git clone https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu && openclaw plugins enable digital-marketing-pro`.

**"OpenClaw uses Claude bundle but loses some features"**
OpenClaw auto-detects our `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as a Claude-compatible bundle, but the native `openclaw.plugin.json` gives first-class discoverability. Both load the same 163 skills from `./skills`. Verify with `openclaw plugins inspect digital-marketing-pro --runtime --json`.

### Grok (xAI Build CLI)

**"`grok plugin install` can't find the plugin"**
Use the direct repo form: `grok plugin install teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu` — the native `.grok-plugin/` manifest pair ships in-repo, so no separate marketplace is needed. Alternatively add the marketplace first: `grok plugin marketplace add teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace` then `grok plugin install digital-marketing-pro`. Append `--trust` to skip the install confirmation. Grok also reads the Claude Code manifests for compatibility, so even a pre-3.31.0 clone loads — the native pair is what gives first-class discoverability.

### General (any platform)

**"Tests in `tests/` fail when I `git clone` locally"**
Run `python tests/run_all.py` from the repo root. All 401 tests are stdlib-only — no `pip install` needed. If they fail, the most likely cause is a Python version mismatch (DMP supports Python 3.8+) or a clone that omitted some `skills/` subdirectories. Try `git clone --depth=1` again.

**"`/digital-marketing-pro:doctor` shows my action as stub_unconfigured"**
That action needs an MCP connector configured. Run `python scripts/connector-status.py --action setup-guide --name <connector-name>` for the exact setup snippet. Add it to your `.mcp.json` under `mcpServers`, restart your agent, and the action becomes `manifest_ready`. See [Connector-aware action resolver](#connector-aware-action-resolver-v3710) for the full readiness model.

**"Where do my brand files actually go?"**
Run `/digital-marketing-pro:output-folder` — it prints the active output directory and (on local Claude Code) opens it in your OS file manager. Default: `~/.claude-marketing/<brand-slug>/` for working state + `~/Documents/DigitalMarketingPro/<brand>/` for finished deliverables. Both configurable via `output-folder`.

**Still stuck?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/teachskillofskills-ai/DigitalMarketingPro-techshu/issues) with the exact error message + platform name + version. We respond within a few days.

## Updating

> **If you see "/plugin isn't available in this environment"** — you're in the standard **Claude chat app** (browser OR installed desktop app). The `/plugin` slash command is **only** supported in two environments: **Claude Code** (the developer CLI / IDE at [claude.com/code](https://claude.com/code), `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) and **Anthropic Cowork**. Everywhere else — `claude.ai` web chat, the Claude Desktop app, mobile — plugins are managed through the UI, not slash commands.
>
> The plugin IS installed (your DM Pro skills work); only the management command is unavailable. Fix:
>
> 1. **In the chat UI** — click the **Plugins** button at the bottom of the chat → **Manage plugins** → find Digital Marketing Pro → look for Update / Refresh / Remove. If no Update button, **Remove** then **Add plugin** → re-install from `teachskillofskills-ai/techshu-marketplace`. The re-pull fetches the latest version.
> 2. **For slash-command management** — switch to Claude Code (CLI or IDE) or Cowork. The plugin runs identically across every Anthropic surface; you're choosing where to type management commands.
>
> Once you're in Claude Code or Cowork, the rest of this section applies.

```
/plugin marketplace update techshu
/plugin uninstall digital-marketing-pro@techshu
/plugin install digital-marketing-pro@techshu
/reload-plugins
```

`/plugin marketplace update` only refreshes the catalog — the uninstall + reinstall is what actually pulls the new version. `/reload-plugins` applies the change without restart.

If a version stays the same but content changed (fast-iteration debugging):
```
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/techshu
/plugin install digital-marketing-pro@techshu
/reload-plugins
```

## About this plugin

DM Pro is built and maintained by the **TechShu AI team** at Indus Net TechShu Digital Pvt. Ltd.
It is the marketing operating system our delivery teams run client engagements on, kept current
against platform and regulatory change as part of that delivery rather than as a side project.

Originally created by Indranil Banerjee, MIT licensed; TechShu's version is maintained separately.

**Why this plugin exists:** Most AI marketing tools generate isolated outputs that don't compose. The 12-Part Strategy Flow encodes the canonical sequence a real engagement actually needs — Stone-vs-Opinion intake, Four Core Documents, Client Validation, Two-Views Model, Decision Matrix, Growth Plan + Yearly Planner, channel fan-out, execution artefacts, creative briefs, continuous improvement loop. Once it's a plugin, every engagement looks the same, handoffs work, and quality is auditable. That's the whole product.

## Release notes

**v3.8.0 (2026-05-27)** — Real native manifests for 5 surfaces. Ships verified-real `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (per the published OpenAI schema), `gemini-extension.json` (at repo root, per Google's `gemini-cli-extensions/data-agent-kit-starter-pack` reference pattern), `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (per the verified Cursor 2.5+ JSON Schema), and `.github/plugin/plugin.json` (verified GitHub Copilot CLI schema; Copilot also recognizes `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as documented fallback). Adds `AGENTS.md` at root (auto-loaded by Codex + Antigravity + Copilot + Cursor agent context chains). All 157 skills share via the Agent Skills open standard — no skill duplication. Replaces the v3.6/v3.7 era invented manifests correctly removed in v3.7.13. Pre-flight verified: 190/190 skills pass the Codex `[a-z0-9-]` regex AND the SKILL.md frontmatter `name` field matches each folder.

**v3.7.13 (2026-05-26)** — Honest positioning. Removed v3.6 / v3.7 era invented manifests (`.codex-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.antigravity/`) + `docs/cross-platform-install.md`. Research confirmed they did not match the platforms' actual install specs. Zero functional changes; the plugin behaved identically in Claude Code + Cowork.

**v3.7.1 (2026-05-24)** — Polish + discoverability pass. README rewritten for organic GitHub/AI-engine discoverability with social-proof badges, install matrix at the top, outcome-focused "What you get in 60 minutes" section, AEO/GEO/compliance keyword density, maintainer block with [techshu.ai](https://techshu.ai), and ⭐ CTAs. Stale asset counts swept across multiple docs. plugin.json description corrected to 69 scripts (was 71). No functional changes; no breaking changes.

**v3.5.0 (2026-05-24)** — May-2026-ecosystem modernisation pass. Six discrete updates: (1) Google AI Mode as 6th AEO/GEO surface; (2) May 2026 broad core algorithm update triage; (3) EU AI Act Article 50 draft implementing guidelines (8 May; 3 June consultation; 2 Aug enforcement); (4) Meta Advantage+ Leads global + Threads ads + brand-safety filters; (5) Gemini Omni + Nano Banana Pro + Veo 3.1 in creative briefs; (6) Claude Code v2.1.149+ `/usage` per-brand cost tracking in agency dashboard.

**v3.4.1 (2026-05-17)** — Audit & corrections pass on v3.4.0. C2PA script rewritten against the real c2pa-python 0.32 API (Builder + Signer.from_info), end-to-end tested. Unified ads MCP entries corrected. Parallel-dispatch speedup claim softened from flat 6× to honest 4–6× parallelism / ~50–80% wall-clock reduction.

**v3.4.0 (2026-05-16)** — C2PA content-provenance for EU AI Act Article 50 compliance (`scripts/embed-c2pa.py`, `/digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata`, pre-publish gate integration). Unified ads-platform MCPs added. Explicit parallel subagent dispatch in `engagement-workflow` + 4 multi-dimensional commands. Anthropic Software Directory submission packet at `SUBMISSION.md`.

**v3.3.0 (2026-05-15)** — May 2026 modernization sweep. Privacy & compliance updates (EU AI Act, DPDP Phase II, NY synthetic-performer law, FTC May 2026 endorsement guidance, CCPA ADMT, CJEU pseudonymized-cookie ruling). Channel guidance updates (LinkedIn algorithm shift, email DMARC + RFC 8058, TikTok USDS, WhatsApp per-message pricing, schema refresh + LLMs.txt, Sora deprecation). AEO/GEO modernization.

**v3.2.x (May 2026)** — `/dm:` → `/digital-marketing-pro:` namespace sweep (~600 references); manifest install format fix; hook-removal gap closure (`/check`, `/status`, embedded hallucination checks, opt-in `auto_save_insights`).

**v3.1.0 (May 2026)** — Removed all global hooks. Prior `SessionStart` and `PreToolUse mcp_.*` matchers were firing across every project regardless of context. Hook config preserved as reference at `hooks/hooks-reference.example.json`.

**v3.0.0 (April 2026)** — 12-Part Engagement Methodology. Four Core Documents (61 explicit steps). Two-Views Model. Decision Matrix. Update-Back Rule. Living Project Instruction File.

**Earlier versions:** see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for v2.7 and earlier.
